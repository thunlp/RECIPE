isbn : 1492913731 isbn-13 : 978-1492913733 for my family , who encouraged me to never stop fighting for my dreams chapter 1 summer vacations supposed to be fun , right ?	1
i wish i had a better answer to that question .	1
starlings , new york is not the place youd expect much to happen .	1
its a small quiet town , the kind where everyone knows your name .	1
its a place where your parents wouldnt even care if you stayed out late biking with your friends .	1
only because everyone felt so safe , so comfy .	1
they dont know the half of it .	1
but i do .	1
i know it all and starlings is not the place where you want to be after dark .	1
the only reason why no one knows this is because jason , emily , seth and i have kept it that way .	1
i walked along the empty road alone , occasionally waving to passing kids on bikes .	1
my backpack was slung over my shoulder , filled with my writing books and sketchpads .	1
i kept my eyes on the shadowed road , watching my every step .	1
usually i was more aware of my surroundings , but today i was tired and didnt care if i rammed into a tree .	1
i kicked a rock into the grass .	1
the sun was starting to set , painting the sky in brilliant oranges and reds .	1
it slipped down the sky , allowing the first stars to peek out from behind the bright curtain .	1
the remaining light cast shadows over everything , creating the illusion that there was double of everything .	1
the world prepared to go into its hours of unreal silence that made it seem magical , and it really was .	1
my phone buzzed and i awoke from my trance .	1
i thumbed the keypad and opened the message seth had sent me .	1
it read : whatcha doing ?	1
i flipped open the pad and wrote : walking home .	1
i shoved it back in my pocket and continued walking .	1
the sun was almost gone and shadows were starting to appear behind everything .	1
i looked at my own shadow , that danced behind me .	1
the phone buzzed again as seth sent me a reply .	1
see anything ?	1
do you want me to meet you ?	1
i glanced at the nearby woods .	1
my ears heard nothing and i didnt see any movement but my hands shook slightly as i typed , nothing , im fine .	1
i didnt open his reply because i knew what it would say .	1
i already knew that it was strangely quiet .	1
maybe i could stay home and sleep one night .	1
or maybe i could finish a painting tonight and watch mom do origami .	1
i turned the corner , and my house came into view .	1
i started to climb the hill when i froze .	1
out of my left eye i saw the outline of a creature .	1
it was heading through the woods in the direction of my house .	1
i swore under my breath and took off for the woods .	1
my feet crunched on the fallen branches and leaves .	1
i could see the creature ahead of me .	1
i didnt have much time .	1
i placed my bag on the ground and crossed my legs .	1
i started to grab my phone but stopped .	1
i didnt need to tell the others , it was just one .	1
and if i was lucky , it would be an easy take down .	1
i closed my eyes and began my mental countdown .	1
the wind picked up around me , as if a wind current had just appeared out of nowhere .	1
5 my body started to feel hot , like i was being hugged by the sun .	1
i hated this part .	1
4 power surged through me as i was freed from my human self .	1
shivers ran down my spine .	1
3 i felt cold , like being dipped in ice water .	1
the breeze picked up even harder .	1
2 i was hollow and could probably see my own body if i opened my eyes .	1
but i could never get the courage to do that .	1
1 the wind died .	1
my body felt normal except it was different .	1
i opened my eyes and looked over to where i just had been or still was .	1
my human body slightly glowed as it sat in meditation under the tree .	1
it didnt move .	1
i could see the monster clearly now that i had stepped into its world .	1
it was hunched over , occasionally touching the ground with one of its curled front paws .	1
dark saliva dripped out of its mouth .	1
the beady black eyes made it no less scary .	1
i knew exactly what it is .	1
a thrasher !	1
a shiver ran down my spine .	1
thrashers were probably one of the most feral and nasty monsters ive ever encountered .	1
they sometimes travel alone or hunt in packs .	1
theyre awful in packs , extremely hard to take out without their knowledge of your presence .	1
i placed an arrow in my bow , and aimed for the head .	1
i couldnt let the creature reach my house .	1
i pulled back the string , and then stopped .	1
i couldnt take out one of these like , this unless i set it on fire .	1
but emily wasnt here .	1
i could take it out with a few arrows but its best to kill thrashers before they realize youre there .	1
instead i lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it , until i could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes .	1
thrashers hate everything and sometimes i wonder how they tolerate each other .	1
i aimed for the head again and released the arrow .	1
it whizzed silently into the thrasher and it howled in pain as the arrow dug into its fur .	1
it whirled around , facing me .	1
a low growl sounded in its throat and it charged .	1
i ducked as it slashed my side and i winced .	1
my shirt slowly turned blue from the trickling wound .	1
yes , blue , my blood is blue .	1
it turned back around and threw its self at me .	1
this time i was prepared .	1
i pulled out my hunting knife out just as he landed on me .	1
he yelped and went limp .	1
i pushed him off and grabbed my fallen bow , the familiar feeling of the wood boosting my confidence .	1
i turned back around and started back where i left off , but then a body slammed into me .	1
i just had enough time to see the thrasher , before the fur and dirt filled my vision .	1
i spit out the clump of wiry hair that had somehow found its way into my gasping mouth .	1
i felt a searing pain as the thrasher raked my left leg .	1
i closed my eyes against the pain , trying to focus myself against the dull throb in my shin .	1
then the thrasher went limp against me .	1
it was hauled off of my body and i found myself looking up into the face of a very unhappy dark blue haired boy .	1
his sword was gripped tightly in his clenched fingers and a look of amusement , or many it was anger , shone on his face .	1
i swallowed and collected my weapons from the ground , not daring to look at my leg .	1
hi seth , this is unexpected .	1
seth glared at me and pulled me up .	1
he was definitely angry at me .	1
i tried to place weight on my leg but winced as pain shot up it .	1
he kicked the dead thrasher one more time before sheathing his sword .	1
you know better jazell then to take on a monster by yourself .	1
you never know what kind it is until you have already changed , he scolded me and i could feel a lecture coming .	1
i looked down at leg .	1
claw marks ran up my shin and my blue blood was soaking my pants .	1
i had to seth ; it was heading for my house .	1
that made me panic a bit .	1
i dont care jazell ; if i hadnt been here i would have found you shredded to small pieces .	1
all you had to do was send me a quick text and i would have showed up to help .	1
but you didnt .	1
i sighed in annoyance , not in the mood for this right now .	1
seth was like this sometimes , strict and serious , but he was normally a jokester .	1
hes strict on the fact that we attack in groups , mostly for the reason that he didnt want anything to happen to our group .	1
i started to slowly limp back to my body but seth just disappeared from my side .	1
he has this annoying skill to be able to just return to his body without having to be near it , which wasnt fair when he wasnt the one injured .	1
i , however , had to stiffly make my way to my dormant human body .	1
once i was near it , i closed my eyes and the wind picked back up .	1
my body felt hot and cold simultaneously as i returned .	1
i reopened my eyes and stood up , stretched , and grabbed my bag .	1
my back sent a chorus of cracks cascading upwards as i straightened myself .	1
i raised the side of my shirt to find the thin , red scratch marks .	1
any injuries i get in my hunter form i have when i become human again , just not as severe .	1
i quickly ran my fingers over the darker , thicker marks on my shin , the skin sore and purple .	1
i quickly checked myself for any other injures i might have acquired from my tangle with the thrasher , but all i found was a bunch of bruises .	1
seth seemed to have disappeared , so i trudged down the road to my house .	1
its cozy familiar blue paint and white shutters helped to relax me as i pushed open the door .	1
my house wasnt very big and fancy ; it was actually pretty plain but thats why i loved it .	1
it had two floors , with a fair sized kitchen and a mini living room .	1
my room was just up the stairs , and it beckoned to me even though i was more interested in dinner .	1
my mom was cooking in the kitchen and my dad was sitting at the kitchen table going through his usual paper work .	1
he looked up as i entered , pushing his glasses back up his face .	1
hi sweetheart , finally home ?	1
he asked giving me a warm smile .	1
i kissed his cheek and my moms before heading toward the stairs .	1
yup .	1
dinners ready in a few minutes , jazell !	1
my mom called as i climbed the stairs , eager to collapse on my bed for a few minutes .	1
got it !	1
i called back .	1
my room was painted a light green , with a bed shoved in the corner and a bookshelf overflowing with books .	1
i had a small desk to the left of my bed that was piled up high with homework and random drawings .	1
i threw my bag on my bed and took off my shoes .	1
then i headed back down stairs to help set the table .	1
my mom handed me some dishes and utensils .	1
i set a plate down in front of my dad .	1
he frowned and pointed to my scratched shin .	1
what happened ?	1
he asked , and studied my leg .	1
i tripped on a crack and scraped my leg .	1
i said flatly , the lie rolling off my tongue easily .	1
i placed my last dish down and sat in my chair .	1
dad chuckled .	1
youre so clumsy .	1
i wouldnt be surprised if you tripped on your own feet .	1
yup , thats me , clumsy .	1
i pulled my leg close to my body .	1
my parents had believed for a long time that i was a klutz .	1
that was the only way to explain the million of cuts and bruises i gained from fighting creatures .	1
the truth is that i have really great balance , which i had gained from so much fighting .	1
i was a little klutzy when i was small , so it was easy for my parents to believe i still was .	1
mom placed the food on the table .	1
dinner !	1
after dinner i went straight up stairs to go to sleep .	1
and hopefully my phone wouldnt stop me like it did most nights .	1
monsters loved to come out at night and cause trouble .	1
they never seem to rest , much to my annoyance .	1
i sighed and rolled over , burying my face in my pillow .	1
i managed to think about something other than creatures that go bump in the night as i drifted off to sleep .	1
in the morning i changed and ran down stairs and left a note saying i was going out to eat with jason , emily and seth .	1
it took me minutes to speed down to the small breakfast restaurant in town .	1
i chained up my bike and walked over to the plastic blue table my friends had occupied .	1
i slid in next to emily , who was talking about some book she had read recently .	1
jason , who sat next to her , was pretending to be fascinated by her rant .	1
emily stopped in mid-sentence when she noticed me sitting beside her .	1
jazell , youre here !	1
she exclaimed .	1
is it true , did you take on a monster by yourself yesterday ?	1
i sighed , shooting a look at seth .	1
yes it is .	1
thanks tattle-tale seth .	1
well you did and i thought the group had a right to know that .	1
seth said sharply .	1
how could you jazell ?	1
you could have gotten seriously hurt .	1
plus i bet all of us want a shot at them too .	1
she huffed and shook her head .	1
the light brown curls that framed her pretty face bounced around playfully .	1
im fine emily , seriously .	1
jason was silent .	1
he never talked much like emily , who was easily the most talkative , friendly person i knew .	1
jason was more of the silent , watching type , who said little but noticed much .	1
i traced in a puddle on the table , avoiding everyones eye contact as they stared at me .	1
emily patted my arm .	1
its okay .	1
we arent mad at you or anything .	1
right seth ?	1
she glared at him .	1
he shrugged .	1
i guess .	1
emily perked up .	1
you see , everyone makes mistakes .	1
seth grunted to himself .	1
emily rolled her eyes .	1
hey seth , its not like you havent done something stupid .	1
we all remember the swamp troll .	1
seth frowned and jason snickered .	1
seth punched his arm .	1
hey dont make me nag you about the time you almost took off my head with your throwing knifes .	1
jason stopped dead and narrowed his eyes .	1
it was an accident .	1
i didnt know youd run that way .	1
alright , we understand that weve all done stupid , foolish things .	1
so lets just add this accident to my list , okay ?	1
i said quickly before the two started something .	1
they nodded but shot each other smirks .	1
i sighed , wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along , with emily and me .	1
its not like they werent foolish enough already .	1
the day when it all changed was still a mystery to us .	1
a lot of things happened that didnt quite make sense .	1
the four of us were already best friends .	1
we were walking through the woods , rambling on about how halloween was almost here and that ms. stecher was still giving us too much homework .	1
then all of a sudden an invisible object slammed into me .	1
i shrieked and couldnt move .	1
it had me pinned to the ground .	1
seth ran forward and grabbed a branch to protect me .	1
it should have gone right through the air but it collided into something and snapped in half .	1
seth dropped it in amazement .	1
emily ran over to me but was plowed to the ground .	1
she screamed , spitting out dirt , twigs and leaves .	1
seth stood watching , terrified .	1
he didnt have a clue as what to do to fight these invisible creatures .	1
none of us did , at that time , because we didnt know what was going on .	1
the world was still a normal place to us at the time .	1
something grabbed seths legs and pulled him against a tree .	1
he kicked and punched but couldnt find the right place to hit his attacker .	1
hold on !	1
jason yelled .	1
i opened my mouth to say that we already were when he vanished .	1
dragged away was my guess .	1
my legs shot with pain .	1
i heard emily yell the first curse words ive heard her say in a while .	1
i spotted her red arm just before my body felt like fire .	1
i closed my eyes and blacked out .	1
i didnt really black out but thats what i thought at the time .	1
i opened my eyes to find i was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body .	1
i saw emily sitting there , saying nothing for once .	1
something fell off my back and i picked it up .	1
it was a wooden bow , and when i reached behind my back i felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there .	1
i ran a finger over the smooth , dark wood and turned to see seth crashing out of the woods .	1
i smirked at him and pointed at his head .	1
you have dark blue hair .	1
i giggled , not knowing why i was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago .	1
he frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head .	1
his eyes widened , and i laughed at the shock on his face .	1
if we were dead , which was my best guess , why not poke fun at him ?	1
seth smiled at me .	1
well , yes but you have green hair .	1
its bright green , like neon green .	1
i shoved my hair in front of my face .	1
it was bright green all right .	1
i stood up and examined myself .	1
i was wearing light brown hunting boots and tight black pants made out of some sort of light cloth .	1
a thick woven jacket was shielding me from the october cold .	1
when i looked back at seth , i realized he had also made an outfit change .	1
he was wearing black leather boots and dark blue pants .	1
his top was a short , brown cloak with a hood and leather belt .	1
a beautiful steel sword with an ornamental hilt was swinging at his side from a woven sheath .	1
oh well , i guess i have green hair .	1
its not that bad .	1
i like green .	1
i rambled as i examined the short hunting knife that was resting in a small sheath on my hip .	1
i ran a finger over the blade before putting it back .	1
how seth and i had acquired such dangerous weapons was anyones guess .	1
i certainly had no clue .	1
i heard footsteps and turned to see emily running over .	1
she was wearing a close fitting , long robe .	1
it was a stunning deep blue with a trim of gold embroidery .	1
she had no weapons dangling from her body were visible from where i was standing .	1
i have pink hair !	1
isnt it cool ?	1
she spun around so we could take in all of its bubblegum pink color .	1
she looked at the bow slung over my shoulder and seths gleaming sword .	1
hey , i dont have anything cool and deadly .	1
why do you both get something like that and i didnt ?	1
its not like you can trust jazell with something sharp or dangerous .	1
hey !	1
we cant trust you either .	1
i pointed out , crossing my arms .	1
arming you is as scary as giving a kindergartener a knife .	1
she gasped .	1
yeah , well , im ignoring you now .	1
she huffed and turned around .	1
there you are !	1
jason exclaimed as he crashed out of the trees , panting .	1
his wavy hair was a deep red that framed his eyes but he didnt seem to have noticed its color change or to care .	1
he was wearing an all black layered tunic and pants with boots that looked as light as mine .	1
if i didnt know it was jason , i would have taken a huge step backwards at his assassin-like appearance .	1
whats going on ?	1
he demanded , eyes flickering from each of us as he took in all of our strange appearances .	1
dont know jason , were as stumped as you .	1
i said .	1
he bit his lip and then smirked .	1
oh , i almost forgot .	1
look at this .	1
he gestured at his belt , grinning mischievously .	1
hanging there were a multitude of thin , dangerous looking knives .	1
he pulled up his sleeve so i could see another one strapped there .	1
cool , huh ?	1
emily had turned to see jason appear .	1
she spotted his knives and groaned , stomping her foot .	1
aw come on !	1
jason whispered behind his hand to seth and i. whats up with her ?	1
seth shrugged .	1
i dont know .	1
girl issues ?	1
i heard that !	1
emily said angrily .	1
thats when suddenly a hideous creature appeared in front of us .	1
it was hunched over , with thick furry skin and wicked claws that shot out of its curled paws .	1
we would soon know them as thrashers , beasts we would get used to seeing .	1
i dont know who screeched louder in fear , but im pretty sure it might have been me .	1
seth pulled his sword out but his hand shook like mad .	1
i clumsily pulled an arrow out of the quiver on my back and struggled to attach it to my bow .	1
how the heck did those people in movies make this look so easy ?	1
i exchanged a look with seth , but he looked as clueless as i did .	1
none of this felt real .	1
i swear , the creature laughed at us .	1
or maybe my fear was making me see and hear things .	1
jason moved silently to stand beside us , one of his throwing knives in his hand .	1
what do we do ?	1
were dead so it cant hurt us right ?	1
i asked .	1
i dont feel dead .	1
jason whispered .	1
i didnt either .	1
in fact , i realized that my whole body was aching from the strange attack i had experienced .	1
and if i was dead , i wouldnt need to breathe so heavily .	1
my heart was racing so fast that it might explode right out of my chest .	1
jason threw the knife he had been holding and it stuck into a tree .	1
he grinned at me and i guess it hit exactly where he wanted .	1
on the count of three , we attack with everything weve got .	1
okay ?	1
seth looked at jason and i .	1
we nodded at him .	1
one , two three !	1
when seth hit three , he charged with his sword .	1
i pulled back and released my arrow .	1
it hit the thrashers front paw .	1
before i could think , i had notched another one on the bow and drew back the string .	1
it was like i had been an archer my whole life .	1
jason threw knife after knife , hitting its mark every time .	1
when the creature went down , seth stood and took a breath .	1
then another tackled him to the ground .	1
i didnt know what to do and jason didnt either .	1
emily ran forward and pointed to seth who was clawing toward his weapon .	1
do something !	1
she screamed .	1
before i could reply , fire shot from her finger .	1
the thrasher yelped and jumped off seth and ran toward emily .	1
she smiled wickedly and held both hands out , pelting the creature with fire .	1
i pulled seth up in time to see the thrasher buried entangled by roots shooting from the dirt .	1
jason threw a knife in the pile to make sure it was really dead .	1
you okay ?	1
i asked seth , and congratulated emily on her new found talent .	1
im fine .	1
he said and limped over .	1
i gasped and pointed to his leg .	1
seth , youre bleeding blue !	1
he just blinked at him , glancing down at his leg .	1
he didnt answer as he tugged at me to start walking back towards where we had last seen ourselves .	1
we could still see our bodies sleeping peacefully , but this time i noticed that we were all faintly glowing blue .	1
i could see the rise and fall of my chest as i breathed .	1
so i really was alive , which made this situation even creepier and stranger .	1
i had two bodies !	1
how was this even possible ?	1
what do we do ?	1
seth , do you any ideas ?	1
she frowned when he didnt answer .	1
seth ?	1
emily spun in a circle but seth was nowhere to be found .	1
seth walked out from behind a tree .	1
but he was normal seth .	1
he had his dirty blonde hair back and was wearing his dirty jeans and shirt from school .	1
no dark red hair , no glimmering sword , no bleeding wound .	1
his warrior self was nowhere to be seen .	1
seth howd you do that ?	1
i asked .	1
he whirled around .	1
whos there ?	1
me , you idiot !	1
i snorted .	1
he stared at the place where i was standing , but his eyes werent focused on me .	1
jazell ?	1
obviously , are you blind ?	1
i can hear you but cant see you .	1
arent you back ?	1
where are you ?	1
no .	1
i said frustrated , now tell us how you got back .	1
he closed his eyes and sat down .	1
i imagined myself in my body , and what is was like to be back .	1
and then i was back to normal .	1
wait .	1
the wind picked up around him and then suddenly he was back , blue hair and all , standing beside his sitting , normal body .	1
wow how did you do that ?	1
emily gasped .	1
i imagined what it was like to fight that creature .	1
and then my body took over .	1
he explained , but i dont think he even understood .	1
then he was gone again and the real seth stood up .	1
try it .	1
i closed my eyes and thought of school and all of ms. stechers homework that i needed to do .	1
then my body was doing the rest .	1
i felt hot and cold , as the winds seemed to pick up .	1
i shivered and opened my eyes .	1
i was lying on the ground .	1
my hair brown hair flopped in my face as i sat up , seeing emily dash over to me .	1
seconds later jason walked through the trees , rubbing his face .	1
seth grinned at all of us ; we were back .	1
thats how it all started .	1
i dont know how we got the gift to become these different people , but we did .	1
thats the mystery and hopefully well solve it one day .	1
we were chosen for some unknown reason , but that reason doesnt matter .	1
all that matters is that we protect this town .	1
jasons eyes flashed .	1
i stood up and leaned over to him .	1
what jason ?	1
monsters , a whole bunch of them .	1
i saw the movement near the pond .	1
he pointed to the pond that was just nestled in the woods .	1
and with that , we were off .	1
running towards the pond to do what we do best , destroy monsters .	1
only this time it was different .	1
chapter 2 we ran and ducked behind a large boulder , huddling together .	1
we all sat down , closed our eyes , and concentrated .	1
i felt a shiver run through my body as i left it and entered my hunter form .	1
i followed emily , jason , and seth as we crept silently over to the monsters , splitting up to surround them .	1
i counted two thrashers , which surprised me .	1
i swear we saw more before .	1
the thrasher turned before we could execute a surprise attack .	1
seth marched over , swinging his sword .	1
jason threw knives calmly at the other monster while emily casted fire by his side .	1
i , however , was jumped on by something entirely new .	1
they were small and stubby , the size of dwarfs or gnomes .	1
their skin was shriveled and grey , and hung off their bodies like cold clothing .	1
their eyes were a bright yellow that matching their teeth and their fingers looked like gnarly old trees .	1
and the smell ; it was awful .	1
they grabbed my feet , back and tugged at my hair .	1
why does everything always happen to me ?	1
i complained .	1
no one heard me .	1
the ugly creatures continued tugging at me like annoying two year old , which made me get really annoyed .	1
get off me ugly looking toad dwarfs .	1
hey , thats what ill call you , toad dwarfs .	1
i smiled at my quick thinking .	1
i could be clever sometimes .	1
take that seth .	1
silly girl , were already called toad dwarfs .	1
the one on my leg croaked .	1
aw darn , never mind then .	1
so much for being clever .	1
the one on my back grabbed my hair .	1
he yanked it back .	1
ow !	1
it may be green but i still value it !	1
i grumbled , trying to pull my head free .	1
i also had no desire to be bald at 16 .	1
hes rising , hes rising !	1
the dwarf said excitedly .	1
his voice cracked at the last word .	1
who the heck is rising and why does it require pulling my hair out !	1
i snapped .	1
hes rising , hes rising !	1
he repeated , full of crazed excitement .	1
i swear i could feel him shaking from exhilaration .	1
whatever , youre now an official maniac .	1
i pulled out my hunting knife .	1
maniacs get destroyed by me .	1
no maniacs are allowed to exist except for me and emily .	1
he jumped off as i stabbed the one on my arm .	1
i grabbed my bow and shot him with an arrow before he his little legs could he him very far .	1
he fell to the ground , the arrow sticking straight up at the sky .	1
now the forest was maniac free .	1
i killed the others and looked up to find the thrashers dead too , probably courtesy of seth .	1
a few dwarfs were also lying dead in front of emily .	1
i walked back to my body and closed my eyes .	1
when i reopened them , i stood , stretching my legs .	1
the four of us headed back to the restaurant together , adrenaline still pumping through my veins .	1
i told emily and the boys about the freaky dwarves .	1
crazy right ?	1
i asked , running a hand through my hair .	1
no one said anything and emily produced a pencil out of her bag .	1
i need a piece of paper , jazell .	1
i ripped one out of my notebook and handed it to her .	1
we sat at the table and emily titled the page : warnings .	1
i didnt know why .	1
okay , jazell , what exactly did he say ?	1
emily asked , pencil poised in the air ready to write .	1
he said , hes rising , hes rising .	1
i have no idea who he meant or if what he said means anything .	1
emily scribbled down , toad dwarf said , hes rising , hes rising .	1
whos coming and is he important ?	1
i stared at the paper , the question swirling in my mind .	1
who did he mean ?	1
now what did the dwarf tell you , seth ?	1
she asked .	1
he said , you wont stop him , little warrior .	1
he frowned at the last part .	1
emily added , toad dwarf told seth , you wont stop him , little warrior .	1
does this mean hes powerful ?	1
did you have to add the little warrior part ?	1
it makes me sound weak .	1
seth complained .	1
i did because we need all the facts .	1
its obvious the dwarf was trying to make you sound weak anyway .	1
now what did he tell you , jason ?	1
he said , he will destroy all half-lings .	1
whats that supposed to mean , anyway ?	1
jason said .	1
she added the last bullet ; toad dwarf said to jason , he will destroy all half-ling .	1
what does half-ling mean ?	1
did the dwarfs tell you anything ?	1
i asked , taking the paper .	1
none of what she wrote on the paper made any sense to me .	1
she shook her head .	1
no and if they did , i was too busy trying to burn them to hear them .	1
she took the paper back .	1
well i think the only thing weve established is that toad dwarves are crazy .	1
seth said .	1
i noticed a thin , red line on his cheek where a thrasher must have scratched him .	1
emily wagged her finger at him .	1
never dis facts .	1
they might save you later in life .	1
seth just snorted .	1
jason punched him in the side .	1
listen to emily .	1
shes actually right sometimes .	1
thank you , jason .	1
she said cheerfully , huh wait , sometimes ?	1
she raised an eyebrow at him .	1
jason scowled at her .	1
im admitting youre sometimes right so dont push it .	1
point taken .	1
she tucked the paper in her drawstring bag .	1
you guys want to go to the park ?	1
they both half nodded , half shrugged , which she took for a yes .	1
so we got up and mounted our bikes .	1
i threw the bike lock in my bag , clipped on my helmet , and followed the others .	1
the three of them raced each other , but i kept my bike behind them .	1
what the dwarf had said was still troubling me and i didnt know if anyone else was feeling the same way .	1
i saw seth slow his bike down and glide next to me .	1
hey , he said .	1
hey .	1
then a question popped into my head , what were you doing alone in the woods yesterday ?	1
he was silent so i yelled to emily , hey , seths lost for words !	1
emily appeared by me and chuckled .	1
whats wrong , seth ?	1
thrasher got your tongue ?	1
before he could reply i said , i asked him what he was doing in the woods yesterday and he didnt have an answer .	1
we all know what this means .	1
yup , hes hiding something .	1
seth , why were you yelling at jazell for being out alone in the woods when you were doing the same ?	1
i wasnt hunting down monsters alone .	1
jazell was doing that , he grumbled , clearly annoyed .	1
but you were still out alone and you yelled at me for doing the same thing .	1
the same thing could have happened to you .	1
do you think youre stronger than the rest of us ?	1
my voice rose slightly at the end of my question .	1
no .	1
he went quiet and tried to avoid our eye contact .	1
now whos keeping secrets ?	1
youre breaking your own rules .	1
why were you out ?	1
emily can be very demanding sometimes , i actually felt a little bad about involving her in my interrogation .	1
just a little .	1
he mumbled something under his breath .	1
i cant hear you .	1
emily snapped .	1
i was out scouting !	1
he shouted , now can you hear me ?	1
yes , and now youve made me deaf !	1
emily yelled back .	1
why were you out scouting in the first place ?	1
i asked calmly , trying not to shout it out like emily .	1
seth gripped the handlebars and i knew he was losing his temper .	1
i was being cautious so we didnt have to worry last night , he said through gritted teeth .	1
he was lying and both of us knew that .	1
i glared at him , nice story seth , now what really happened ?	1
he didnt say anything and he rode ahead to get beside jason , who was in the lead .	1
the park slowly came in view .	1
it was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids .	1
the woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street .	1
a fountain was near the entrance along with a bike rack .	1
thats where we parked our bikes .	1
i clicked the lock together and grabbed my bag .	1
emily was fumbling with her bike lock , which was old and rusted and usually refused to work without a fight .	1
i walked over and tried to help her .	1
why do you think seth wont tell us what he was doing ?	1
i asked , watching her because she had refused to let me help .	1
pride purposes ?	1
he was yelling at you when he broke his own rules .	1
he just doesnt want to admit he did she said through her wild hair .	1
her lock finally clicked and she stood up .	1
the boys were walking side by side towards the play set .	1
it wasnt actually that small but it looked that way from the street .	1
there were six swings and a tower with four slides attached to it .	1
i ran after them with emily right behind me .	1
i slowed down next to jason and put my arm on his shoulder .	1
hey jason , do you know seths a liar ?	1
i asked and seth shot me a bad look .	1
jason frowned at me , what are you talking about , jazell ?	1
he broke his own rules .	1
he was out scouting without telling us .	1
i smiled and jason stiffened .	1
what ?	1
he growled .	1
are you two trying to create trouble ?	1
seth cut in .	1
emily put her arm around my shoulders .	1
no , we just want the truth , emily said sweetly .	1
yeah okay , whatever .	1
seth shoved his hands in his pockets , and glared at the ground .	1
i sat on one of the swings next to emily .	1
i traced the sticky metal rings and sighed .	1
emily was on her phone .	1
i saw seth and jason arguing off to the side .	1
everything was back to normal .	1
there was even a dwarf climbing the slide .	1
wait , hold on .	1
a dwarf ?	1
i elbowed emily in the arm , uh emily , is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing ?	1
i nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise .	1
she jumped off the swing and grabbed me by the arm .	1
she ran over to jason and gripped his arm with her free hand , pulling us both after her .	1
seth frowned but had no choice but to follow .	1
wheres the dwarf ?	1
she asked quickly .	1
climbing the slide .	1
weird huh ?	1
i almost tripped but i caught myself .	1
she pushed us into the woods , we got to move fast before someone gets hurt .	1
make sure no one is around .	1
in a matter of seconds , i had an arrow in my bow , seth had his sword in his hand and jason had his hands full of knives .	1
the dwarf was sitting on the edge of the slide , looking like an ugly version of a toddler , and a few more came out of the woods to join him .	1
we tried to sneak up without being spotted but one of the dwarves turned his head and saw us .	1
he immediately launched himself onto emily .	1
she screeched and i thought i saw one of the kids turn around .	1
he crawled up to her ear and whispered something that i couldnt hear .	1
she froze , but i saw her place her hands on his wrinkled skin .	1
fire flared from her fingertips , scorching his skin .	1
he let out a screech and vaulted off her , running as fast as his legs could take him .	1
i held an arrow out and emily set it ablaze .	1
i drew back , launching the arrow , and watching it as it hit the dwarf in the back .	1
the fire charred its dying body and i looked away to face my new attacker .	1
one jumped on my head and i swung with my knife .	1
it yelled into my ear , the one will rise , the one will rise !	1
he will destroy you !	1
i stabbed at him again , who ?	1
youre being too vague !	1
he jumped off me and ran into the woods .	1
he disappeared before i could notch an arrow and shoot him .	1
soon we were alone again .	1
emily made us all meet by the fountain .	1
i guess we all heard some weird dwarf talk .	1
okay ill start this time .	1
he said , kill all the dwarfs you like , but kojas will rise .	1
at least we have an idea of who they might be talking about .	1
she added to her list ; toad dwarf said , kill all you like but kojas will rise .	1
is kojas the person theyve been talking about ?	1
who is he ?	1
he told me , the one will rise , the one rise !	1
he will destroy you !	1
thats almost the same thing as last time .	1
i tapped the fountain .	1
she scribbled , toad dwarf said , the one will rise , the one will rise !	1
he will destroy you !	1
is kojas rising ?	1
seth , do you have anything ?	1
emily clicked her pencil .	1
seth shook his head , but jason spoke up , he said , the king will rise .	1
then he left .	1
emily added one last bullet ; toad dwarf said to jason , the king will rise .	1
her list was : toad dwarf said to jazell , hes rising , hes rising .	1
whos coming and is he important ?	1
toad dwarf told seth , you wont stop him , little warrior .	1
does this mean hes powerful ?	1
toad dwarf said to jason , he will destroy all half-ling .	1
what does half-ling mean ?	1
toad dwarf said to emily , kill all you like but kojas will rise .	1
is kojas the person theyve been talking about ?	1
who is he ?	1
toad dwarf said to jazell , the one will rise , the one will rise !	1
he will destroy you !	1
is kojas rising ?	1
toad dwarf said to jason , the king will rise .	1
she placed her notes in the middle so we could read it .	1
what does this all mean ?	1
i asked her .	1
she was silent , i guess the person theyre talking about is kojas , but we dont know who he is , or if hes important .	1
well , im thinking hes important because these weird dwarfs keep talking about him .	1
maybe hes their idol or something .	1
i said .	1
well , seth stated , maybe we should ask the dwarfs where he is .	1
thatll be hard .	1
emily pointed out .	1
they hardly tell us anything as it is .	1
you try squeezing out information from one of these pests .	1
i did .	1
whatever guys , were getting nowhere .	1
hey emily you want to sleep over tonight ?	1
i asked .	1
emily frowned , its my turn , jazell , and youre coming over my house .	1
honestly , em , just come over no , she said and crossed her arms stubbornly .	1
i sighed and ran a hand through my hair , knowing it was useless to argue with her when her mind was made up .	1
fine , ill call my parents .	1
but next time youre coming to my house .	1
she nodded , her curls bobbing .	1
fair enough .	1
okay then , see you two later .	1
jason turned around with seth on his heels .	1
wait a minute you two .	1
its only , i popped open my phone , 3pm .	1
we still have the rest of the day .	1
i shoved the phone back in my pocket .	1
hey , dont take this personally , but we want to hang out alone .	1
sobye !	1
jason said and jumped on his bike .	1
seth unchained his bike and rode off with him .	1
i realized then that seth had barely said anything the whole time , but he was already out of sight .	1
id have to question him later .	1
i sighed , well , at least we can hang out early .	1
well , while you were arguing with the boys i called home and they said you could come over now .	1
emily flashed me one of her million-watt smiles .	1
great !	1
i piped .	1
ill call home quickly to check with my parents .	1
i called home and my parents said i could go , which wasnt much of a surprise .	1
ive been to plenty of sleepovers at emilys , so my parents didnt mind .	1
plus , our parents were close and emilys family was practically an extension of our own .	1
we rode over to her house and parked our bikes in the garage .	1
we knocked on the door and a woman answered .	1
emilys mom was short , small and bony .	1
her light brown hair was almost blonde without any gray in it .	1
the woman definitely did not look her age at all , and she was still as beautiful as i imagined she was in her youth .	1
she smiled warmly at us , her smile a reflection of emilys .	1
hello girls , come in .	1
emily , dear , can you put your laundry away ?	1
after you do that , you can hang out in your room .	1
emily nodded and disappeared inside .	1
her mom moved aside so i could walk in .	1
i unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs , looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time .	1
i pushed open emilys bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed .	1
she pulled out my bag and threw it to me so i could set up my sleeping bag on her rug .	1
her mom called us downstairs , hopefully for food .	1
she held a box of pizza .	1
you two can eat upstairs or down here .	1
she already knew our answer and handed us paper plates .	1
i took three slices of pizza and ran upstairs .	1
emily and i sat on the floor , eating pizza and doodling nonsense in her notebook .	1
the time ticked by to one oclock in the morning .	1
we sat side by side on her bed near the window , and i played with the fridge on the edge of one of her pillows .	1
i looked down at emilys pajamas , which were covered in sun-tanning penguins .	1
typical emily .	1
nice pjs emily .	1
i chuckled .	1
she stuck her tongue out , what do you have against sun-tanning penguins ?	1
nothing !	1
i smiled to myself .	1
i shouldnt be talking ; i was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs .	1
emily leaned back to turn off her desk light .	1
it clicked off and i gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed .	1
night emily .	1
i yawned .	1
emily didnt reply because her face was pushed up against the window .	1
her body was ridged and she didnt move .	1
i crawled over to the window .	1
what is it , em ?	1
i whispered , a nervous feeling creeping into my stomach .	1
she backed away from the window so i could see .	1
i saw nothing at first but then i spotted movement .	1
the recognizable lines of toad dwarfs marched around the trees , and i could tell they were up to no good again .	1
they were really starting to get on my nerves .	1
looks like i wasnt sleeping after all .	1
chapter 3 sneaking out after hours isnt easy , especially at emilys house .	1
her parents arent sound sleepers .	1
if we werent really careful , theyd wake up and then wed have some answering to do .	1
and i dont think theyd understand our reason .	1
i followed emily down the stairs , in our pajamas , to the door .	1
we were careful not to make a sound but i listened closely to the sound of her dad snoring .	1
when the snore rang clearly through the house , i breathed a sigh of relief .	1
we threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door .	1
the summer night air was cool but a little sticky and clammy , making our bodies feel damp .	1
i followed emily down to the back of the garage , where we sat down and entered the monsters world .	1
i pushed my green hair back and hid behind a tree beside emily to watch the dwarfs .	1
there must have been more than ten of them gathered together .	1
they were parading around a blazing camp fire , mumbling and talking about things i couldnt hear over the flames .	1
some more emerged from the woods and joined them , their shadows dancing behind them .	1
then all of them suddenly broke out into an ominous song : he will rise to the heavens , from the very pits of hell .	1
to take control of our world , and the gift- less ones as well .	1
he will rule with a flaming torch , and save those who are worthy .	1
and for those who arent , well , you better watch out !	1
they all broke out in crazed laughs , which gave me the impression that each and every one of them was mad .	1
hell , i knew they were already mad .	1
they threw dirt at the fire and continued their wild laughs .	1
emily shuddered by me as they lifted their voices in another chorus .	1
he will rise to the heavens , from the very pits of hell , to crush all half-lings and to take their very souls .	1
for the king will rule all , with his cruelty and rage .	1
i wouldnt want to be that half-ling , that he spears through the head !	1
this time they were rolling on the floor , howling in laughter .	1
well , i didnt think this was very funny at all .	1
what was funny about getting speared through the head ?	1
i had a feeling the king they were talking about was kojas , and i really didnt want to be around to meet him , especially if it meant my head was going to become well acquainted with a weapon .	1
that is , if i was even a half-ling like the dwarfs claimed i was .	1
they laughed and sat in a tight circle mumbling things i didnt catch .	1
my hand slipped to my knife but emily grabbed my hand to keep me from drawing it from its leather case .	1
no jazell not yet , maybe we can learn a little more from them .	1
her voice was a hoarse whisper .	1
but emily , its awful to listen to .	1
cant we just destroy the camp ?	1
i went for my bow instead .	1
no , she said a little more clearly .	1
we have to wait and see what happens .	1
plus , we cant just randomly attack them .	1
i didnt really care .	1
the song was repeating itself in my head , like a taunt .	1
without thinking , i aimed and shot the nearest dwarf .	1
as soon as he went down , the whole camp was facing our direction .	1
i was standing up now where everyone could see me .	1
there was no point in hiding anymore .	1
emily stayed hidden behind the tree , and i could feel her glare trying to burn me into ashes .	1
youll wish you never shot one of his loyal servants .	1
a dwarf seemed to laugh at me .	1
kojas will destroy you , half-ling .	1
that is it , im sick of your riddles !	1
give me a darn straight answer or ill shoot every single one of you , i spat angrily , leveling my bow .	1
kill all you like half-ling , but that wont help you in the end .	1
you will pay heavily in a terrible death worth all the loyal lives youve slayed , the dwarf proclaimed , and his friends bellowed out an agreement .	1
i dont care what the heck you say about dying because nothing will stop me from killing all of you !	1
youre making no apparent sense at all , and i dont care what stupid message youre trying to send me !	1
i hissed so bad i think that i spit .	1
gross .	1
oh but you will care , half-ling .	1
the dwarf was now whispering and all the others had fallen silent so they could hear .	1
you will care because in the end , he will destroy you once hes done using you .	1
my arms were still tense and my muscles whined in protest as i held my arrow back in full draw .	1
use me to do what ?	1
i spoke , using the same tone as him .	1
the dwarfs eyes were twinkling in happiness .	1
he seemed happy to tell me the answer .	1
to take over the gift-less ones world , why else half-ling ?	1
youre the connection between igneeria and your world .	1
he needs you and he has made that clear .	1
the world had fallen to silence .	1
i spoke in barely a whisper , igneeria , thats your world isnt it ?	1
what does kojas want ?	1
the dwarf seemed to be getting extremely excited now , he wants your world and all other worlds because he is a mighty king who wishes to expand his kingdom .	1
so how would we help him do that ?	1
i asked , stalling .	1
we just exterminate the pests .	1
youre a half-ling !	1
youre the bridge to our world .	1
now if you dont mind we would like to finish you now , and bring you to the king .	1
the dwarf said politely and snickered , approaching me .	1
i backed up slowly .	1
uh , i mind a lot actually .	1
i said quickly but i guess they didnt really want my opinion .	1
emily jumped out from behind the trees and lifted a flame .	1
she twirled it around with the movement of her hands and shot it at the nearest dwarf .	1
that started what seemed like a war .	1
all the dwarfs scrambled towards us and i simply shot them and emily fried them .	1
then jason and seth dissolved from the shadows and entered the clearing .	1
what are you two doing here ?	1
i yelled across to them , annoyed that they hadnt made their presence known earlier .	1
seth fought his way over to me , why do you need to know ?	1
because you just randomly appeared and i would like to know what youre doing in emilys backyard in the middle of the night .	1
i pointed out and took down the last dwarf .	1
we gathered around the barely burning embers , after we had re-entered our own world .	1
emily and i quickly summed up what we had learned from the dwarfs .	1
jason listened and didnt speak , like usual , and for once seth didnt interrupt .	1
when we were finished nobody said a word as they soaked up everything that had happened .	1
it seemed like it was just too much for all of us to take in .	1
all of a sudden seth spoke up .	1
why are you wearing sun-tanning penguin pajamas , emily ?	1
emily glared at him , what do you have against penguins ?	1
and why cant i wear pajamas ?	1
its the middle of the night you know .	1
seth wasnt bothered by her glare .	1
so it wouldnt have been hard to change .	1
seth should have realized that he was pushing emilys limited patience too far and that he should shut up .	1
she reached down and grabbed a small stick .	1
then she smacked seth across the head with it .	1
live with it seth .	1
emily said every word apart and wacked him again .	1
seth made a small , ow .	1
every time she hit him .	1
he grimaced and said , stop hitting me already !	1
alright , she made a motion to put the stick down and hit him again in the head .	1
he glared at her and she threw it on the floor , now im done .	1
so jason , i faced him and he looked up at me , since seth wont tell me ill ask you .	1
how did you guys find us ?	1
we followed a dwarf that was running here .	1
if we didnt get lost , we would have been here faster , jasons face turned the color of his red igneerian hair .	1
its okay , at least you answered me , i shot seth a look .	1
well if its okay with you boys , we would like to get to bed .	1
its almost 1:30 in the morning , and i would like to get home before my dad wakes himself up , emily said , and walked towards her house .	1
i waved quickly and followed .	1
the rest of the night was quiet and didnt include singing dwarfs .	1
before we went to bed though there was a lot of furious writing as emily tried to write everything down .	1
after that , was all sleep .	1
in the morning , we ate pancakes that emilys mom had made us and set off for the park .	1
we happened to run into jason and seth half way and at the same time watched a pole freeze in the middle of july .	1
you dont get to see that every day , which usually meant there was a monster involved .	1
jason , seth and emily saw it too because i was chasing after them as we all ran for the few trees ahead .	1
in a few seconds i had a complete view of the culprit .	1
and strange enough it was a frost beast .	1
frost beasts are the cutest monsters youll ever see .	1
theyre the size of medium dogs and their pelts are a light , icy blue .	1
they may be cute but if you dont watch out , they could easily be the most dangerous monsters around .	1
dont let them breath on you , or youll freeze to death .	1
literally .	1
the frost beast whimpered at me , showing me the cutest eyes imaginable .	1
i wanted to melt and hug him but i knew better not to fall victim to its trick .	1
i drew a single arrow and aimed it at its throat .	1
i didnt want to kill it , but i knew if i didnt , it would kill me without a second thought .	1
frost beasts dont appear until the end of fall and into winter .	1
they love the cold and cant stand the heat .	1
thats why i knew something was wrong right away , because it shouldnt have been here .	1
it was against its nature and when nature goes wrong , thats a big sign .	1
i pulled back on the string but emily ran forward and shot fire .	1
the beast simply opened its mouth and breathed .	1
what was a shot of fire was now a single icicle that landed on the ground in front of it .	1
instead jason came forward and attacked with his knives .	1
the beast froze the first few into harmless ice cubes but finally went down when one got past its defenses .	1
behind his body appeared seven thrashers and many more frost beasts .	1
it was like a monster reunion .	1
ive never seen so many in one place before .	1
a thrasher pack had at least six or seven but there must have been more than ten monsters total .	1
it was scary .	1
right then , right at that very moment , i knew something was terribly wrong .	1
they all stopped in front of us , all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us .	1
they made me confused , from the warm feeling the frost beasts gave me to the cold feeling the thrashers inflicted .	1
they exchanged some sort of signal , including grunts and yips , and slowly advanced on us .	1
the dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey .	1
the cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger .	1
the dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach .	1
i managed to push it down before it breathed on me .	1
my legs froze in place .	1
emily i need some defrost .	1
i called to her as the cold seeped through my pants and bit at my skin .	1
emily turned her head and was about to reply when the dog caught her robe .	1
she spun around , shooting fire and completely forgetting my cry for help .	1
at the same time my dog attacker pushed me to the ground , freeing my legs for me .	1
get off me mutt .	1
i growled at his face .	1
he stared down at me , debating whether or not to freeze me right away .	1
that was his mistake because while he was waiting , i had brought my hunting dagger down on him .	1
i stood up and shook the heavy body off .	1
i didnt even have time to breath before one of the thrashers decided that they would like to have a taste of me .	1
i decided that i didnt want to be shredded like some old rug , so i moved out of his path .	1
that was the worst mistake i made , without even realizing it .	1
at the same time another thrasher was heading in my direction , and by moving out of the way from the first one , i had placed myself in the path of the second one .	1
it slammed into my side at such a great force i tasted blood in my mouth , when i hit the ground .	1
then i felt pain , saw blood , and then nothing at all .	1
chapter 4 i heard muffled voices around me as i regained consciousness .	1
my head throbbed slightly , and so did my side and my tongue .	1
that explained why i had tasted blood ; i must have bitten it .	1
for a second i thought i had returned to my human self when i heard a blast of fire that probably came from emily .	1
seth when will she wake up ?	1
a voice said .	1
then i realized it was emily .	1
shes alive and shell wake up soon .	1
stop nagging me , a different voice said that was obviously seths .	1
he was really close to me because i could feel his breath on my face and his voice was very loud .	1
which wasnt helping my throbbing head at all .	1
but when ?	1
i dont like just staying here , when more monsters might come .	1
we cant do two things at once .	1
emily nagged anyway .	1
i could just picture her bouncing up and down on her heels , full of tension .	1
i felt rush of hot air near my left side .	1
seth was probably sighing , we cant move her emily .	1
if we could , we would .	1
i opened my eyes to see seth face hovering above me .	1
emily was pacing in the background and jason was standing off to the side , looking very uninterested in the current situation .	1
seth smiled at me and i felt myself blush .	1
it was kind of embarrassing to get knocked out when no one else did .	1
welcome back , zombie hunter girl , seth teased .	1
how long was i out ?	1
i asked , blushing brighter .	1
except i couldnt pin down the reason why .	1
seth frowned , i dont know but it seemed like forever .	1
you scared us , jazell .	1
especially seth , emily piped up behind him .	1
he was the one going crazy to bandage you and was worrying more than the rest of us .	1
seths face reached a new undiscovered level of red , i didnt want to lose a friend .	1
right emily trailed off and smirked at him , wiggling her eyebrows .	1
seth squirmed slightly and avoided her gaze .	1
i started to laugh but in morphed into a cough instead .	1
i clutched my midsection to find it was covered in bandages .	1
what exactly happened ?	1
i questioned .	1
seth glanced at emily and back at me , i dont really know .	1
we turned around to see you being mauled by a thrasher .	1
before either of us could do anything , some light appeared out of nowhere .	1
when it died down , we found you lying on the ground unconscious .	1
thats basically it .	1
we dont know what the light was .	1
emily added .	1
but whatever it was , it saved your life .	1
uh i have a feeling i should thank it , but i dont know how you thank light .	1
i muttered .	1
you thank it like you would thank anyone else , a voice said .	1
i almost jumped to the moon in surprise .	1
out of nowhere someone , or something , appeared beside jason .	1
i think jason was more scared because he actually jumped into the air .	1
as it came into view , it became obvious that it was a girl .	1
she in a yellow cloak and had dazzling red hair .	1
she smiled warmly at us with her chocolate brown eyes and i realized she had pointed ears .	1
so i basically made the conclusion that she wasnt human .	1
uh okay i said slowly .	1
she giggled , wow i never thought id scare a bunch of half-lings but i guess i did .	1
you didnt scare me , jason said quickly .	1
yeah okay , jason , emily said sarcastically .	1
i sat up and leaned on seth because i would fall if i didnt , and emily and jason were too busy giving each other looks to help me .	1
what and who are you ?	1
i stared at her .	1
she rolled her eyes , a light pixie , duh .	1
i blinked , a light pixie ?	1
yes , a light pixie .	1
are you deaf ?	1
she retorted .	1
uh , no , im not .	1
i dont know what a light pixie is or why you saved my life , but thank you i said , trying not to snap back .	1
well you are a half-ling and we need as many of them as we can get , she pointed out .	1
plus im not evil , so why shouldnt i help you out ?	1
uh thanks i guess .	1
this situation was extremely awkward to me .	1
she winked and disappeared in a flash .	1
i limped over to my body ignoring seths yells to tell me to sit down .	1
i felt the wind pick up and was whisked back to my normal self .	1
i felt fine except for the fact it hurt to stretch my left side .	1
i would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning , but i was used to that feeling .	1
we began to walk back towards the park when jason stopped us .	1
hey can seth and i catch you guys later ?	1
we have something to do .	1
jason grabbed seth and they took off .	1
emily raised an eyebrow , should we be concerned ?	1
nah theyre boys , let them do what they have to do , i said with a quick sigh .	1
while we were walking the boys appeared in front of us , holding something behind their backs .	1
they seemed to be fighting giggles which usually meant they were hiding something .	1
or they were about to do something that fell under their category of funny .	1
hi guys , seth said still fighting a smirk .	1
hi , i replied cautiously .	1
what are you guys hiding ?	1
jasons face twisted up and a snort of laughter fought its way out of his nose .	1
nothing .	1
right emily gave me a look that said , is this good or bad ?	1
i didnt really have an answer for her but i knew that whatever was coming , it wasnt going to be good .	1
so jason , we have a question for you .	1
i nodded towards emily .	1
jasons face grinned in a seriously weird way that screamed , weirdo !	1
he shifted his hands and said , what ?	1
emily stepped forward , we want to know what youre but she never finished .	1
she had triggered it all .	1
jason had been hiding two blue , full , water pistols behind his back and was now shooting them at emilys face .	1
she was holding up her hands and letting out some sort of squeal .	1
seth had been hiding a full two-handed water gun behind his back and the end was pointed at no other than me .	1
you wouldnt , i said , my voice dark .	1
seth gave me a maniacs grin , you already know the answer to that .	1
then he shot me right in the face .	1
i blocked most of the spray from my face but water still leaked through my fingers .	1
i felt the cold water seep through my clothes and onto my skin as seth continued to soak me .	1
crap jason , shut it off !	1
emily hollered but it didnt work because i heard her yell again as he sprayed her hair .	1
i couldnt see anything because my eyes were half shut and i was afraid seth would wash my eyes out .	1
seth seriously , stop .	1
you cant command boys to do anything and to prove that , seth shot my butt .	1
eventually they stopped , only because three water guns can hold only so much water and emily and me looked like we could kill .	1
we were both completely soaked to the bone and even though in was the middle of summer , we were shivering .	1
the boys looked completely satisfied with how we looked .	1
after emily and i gave them a look , they tore down the street and disappeared .	1
emily squeezed the bottom of her shirt , i hate them so much right now .	1
water gushed onto the street .	1
i wrung my hair out .	1
i agree and if we didnt need them , id be planning their funeral .	1
emily smiled , id be helping you .	1
do you think they would like pink coffins ?	1
totally , i laughed and grabbed my dry bag .	1
lets go home .	1
want to crash at my place ?	1
emily flipped open her phone , her fingers danced on the keys and paused .	1
then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket .	1
yup i can .	1
youre always one step ahead .	1
always .	1
so what do you think we should do ?	1
emily asked from my bed later on .	1
i swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth .	1
i dont know , ambush them back ?	1
they might see that coming , she pointed out , and its really obvious .	1
well , they think we wont do that because that is exactly what they would be expecting , so by actually doing it , we can trick them , i rambled on and grabbed another strawberry .	1
emily tapped her lip with her pencil and straightened her pink pajamas .	1
i have no clue what you just said jazell .	1
i laughed , what i meant was that we should ambush them .	1
give them a piece of what they did to us .	1
emilys eyes lit up , you mean use water guns and water balloons i added .	1
and a trebuchet to launch the balloons !	1
emily scribbled furiously on her paper .	1
i can build one easily .	1
sweet , but when do we do it ?	1
all four of us hang out every day .	1
i can solve that problem .	1
we just tell them we want a day to do girl things and theyll butt right out , she slid onto the floor and snatched a strawberry .	1
i grinned , this is going to be some fun revenge !	1
you can say that again .	1
okay , i said , this is going to be some fun revenge .	1
she wacked me in the head with my pillow , youre so weird .	1
well thats the way i am , deal with it , i wacked her back with my own pillow .	1
no i will not deal with it , she walloped me in the head one more time .	1
i need you for team penguin , and i dont need a smarty pants .	1
how come you get to name the team ?	1
i asked .	1
because i was the one who got shot first .	1
early the next day , which wasnt that early because we got up around ten oclock , we gathered my old water gun and some water balloons .	1
emily brought down the trebuchet shed spent all night building and we took off on our bikes .	1
emily led the way to jasons where she was pretty sure the boys would be .	1
we hid our bikes in the trees and snuck up to their backyard .	1
jason and seth appeared to be setting up some airplane that they built from scratch .	1
they were muttering to each other and assembling a table they would use for a launch pad .	1
i grabbed my water gun and emily took out her trebuchet , with her balloons , and we snuck up on them .	1
i held my hand up to stop emily , waiting until jason and seth were grabbing the airplane out of a box and lowered my hand .	1
revenge !	1
i yelled , and ran out from behind the trees , with emily following .	1
the looks on their faces were priceless .	1
they spun around just in time as emily launched a balloon right at jasons face .	1
i aimed at seth , who i soaked in minutes .	1
their faces looked like they had seen a dinosaur come back to life .	1
jason scrambled away from emily but she nailed him so many times it didnt matter , he was already soaking wet .	1
the last of my water leaked out the back of the gun and we just stood there .	1
jason smiled but you could see he was hiding the anger in his face .	1
seth was emotionless ; he didnt give any sign on what he was feeling .	1
so you felt like getting us back ?	1
jason asked .	1
emily glared at him , you deserved it because you soaked us too .	1
so , he rolled his eyes , you thought you could just ambush us .	1
have you learned nothing and that we might want revenge now .	1
then you will and so on .	1
youve started a really long war .	1
who says the penguins cant win a war , huh ?	1
we just won right now , emily said .	1
the penguins ?	1
does that really matter ?	1
she hissed .	1
youre on .	1
jason smirked , alright then , penguins , if you want a water war , you got one .	1
youre on too !	1
this whole time seth didnt say a word , which was strange .	1
usually seth did all the talking while jason stood watching but now jason was doing all the talking and seth was the one watching .	1
he stood there and seemed unmoved from being soaked by my water gun .	1
his face was blank and he was staring at nothing .	1
it wasnt the seth i was friends with .	1
while emily and jason were bickering i said , seth ?	1
seth didnt answer .	1
he acted like he didnt hear me .	1
seth ?	1
hello earth to seth , i repeated .	1
no answer again .	1
seth is there something wrong ?	1
i whispered .	1
he didnt answer me again .	1
he continued to stare at the woods as if he expected a flying deer to leap out , wearing pink socks .	1
what the heck seth , are you deaf now ?	1
i waited for a sign that he heard me to appear on his face , but it remained blank .	1
emily huffed loudly , expect something from jazell and me soon jason .	1
were out of here .	1
see you around .	1
she grabbed my hand and pulled me away .	1
seth turned to see me leave and the look gave me a dark feeling inside .	1
his face was masked with one emotion , one that made me vow to myself that i would find out what he was hiding , what he was keeping a secret .	1
that emotion was not seth , not the one i knew .	1
it made me feel the same way and i didnt know why .	1
fear .	1
chapter 5 the water war continued with us getting them and them getting us .	1
we attacked them with a pool , and they threw water balloons at us while we were on bikes .	1
it was pretty simple , but the whole time all i noticed was seth .	1
he wasnt the same to me anymore ; he always had this mask on his face , hiding himself from the rest of us .	1
i had to find out what was wrong , and soon .	1
jazell , are you paying attention ?	1
emilys annoyed voice broke my day dreams .	1
i snapped back to attention , uh yes , i am emily .	1
just for the record , what are we talking about ?	1
jazell youre hopeless !	1
were talking about what to do next , she scowled .	1
wait , an idea jumped into my head , how about we meet under a truce .	1
emily stared at me .	1
a truce ?	1
seriously ?	1
that is the complete opposite of what were doing .	1
i know but trust me ; we need to meet under a truce .	1
what about monster fighting and this whole puzzle with the dwarfs ?	1
did we just forget all about it or are we not going to do our job anymore ?	1
were still fighting , jazell .	1
were all just having some fun because its summer and not school .	1
well get back to it later .	1
listen , why dont we meet once and then go back to this water war .	1
at least we should think about this a little bit .	1
i pushed the paper of warnings in front of her face .	1
fine , she snatched the paper out of my hands .	1
well meet jazell , okay ?	1
are you happy now ?	1
then well go back to soaking each other randomly .	1
yes , im happy .	1
i didnt call a truce for the warnings .	1
i did it because thats when id talk to seth and get his secret out of him .	1
then maybe i could help him and stop having to watch his miserable face .	1
emily made a face and left the room to dial jasons number and tell him about the meeting .	1
i waited patiently for her to come back in my room .	1
i cant wait long because i have a tendency to go crazy , so i walked up to my window sill and looked at the sky .	1
i stared it and turned around to see emily come back in .	1
but not before my eyes caught a flash of blue .	1
emily and i parked our bikes and headed into the woods and towards the clearing .	1
we stepped into it , and i took in the familiar feeling .	1
out of all the places weve all been , this place felt the safest , as if it were surrounded by a good force , not bad for once .	1
we often met here when we werent all together .	1
i sat down next to emily on a log .	1
minutes later jason and seth emerged from the trees .	1
they werent smiling or doing anything suspicious so i figured we were safe , for now .	1
they sat down across from us .	1
i noticed that seth was avoiding my eyes .	1
so whose crazy idea was it to meet under a truce when were having so much fun wreaking havoc on each other ?	1
jason asked .	1
emily sighed and pointed at me , this crazy person right here .	1
so what do you want ?	1
he continued and eyed me .	1
i took a small , quiet breath and said what i had planned , i want to work on the dwarf problem .	1
i nodded towards emily , signaling her to take out her paper .	1
she groaned and pulled the folded piece of paper out of her pocket .	1
she unfolded it and placed it in front of us .	1
while we studied it , i tried to catch seths eye , but he didnt look at me .	1
i felt something boil deep within me-the anger at him .	1
we were his best friends , we told each other everything and now he was keeping something from us .	1
i could see it was eating at him , so why didnt he tell us what it was ?	1
that was the question that was making me steam .	1
seth out with it !	1
i didnt know why i shouted .	1
i startled him and he looked up at me .	1
what do you mean , jazell ?	1
i mean tell me what youre hiding !	1
i yelled at him .	1
he stood up , im not hiding anything .	1
his voice was level but it shook slightly .	1
i stepped towards him and gave him a hard shove .	1
he stumbled back and fell on the ground .	1
he looked up at me , waiting for what i would do next .	1
why are you keeping a secret from me ?	1
i repeated , my voice as cold as an icicle .	1
seth didnt answer me , instead he did the most cowardly and annoying thing you can do .	1
the idiot ran off .	1
seth pushed himself up at a surprising speed and raced off into the woods .	1
i did the crazy thing that people like me would do and followed him .	1
i looked over my shoulder to see if emily and jason were coming but both of them stared at me , baffled .	1
their faces disappeared as i was swallowed by the trees .	1
i skidded to a halt and scanned the trees .	1
i didnt see any trace of where seth could have ran .	1
that shows how much i know about asking questions .	1
i dont get the answers and boom ; i lose it and become a demanding person .	1
i walked more slowly , watching the trees .	1
i sent a silent prayer that seth hadnt entered igneeria , because then i would never find him .	1
what bugged me the most was that seth didnt fight me when i pushed him down .	1
he just sat on the ground not saying anything at all in his own defense .	1
now , i couldnt find him anywhere and i would never get my answer .	1
i heard a large snap to my right and i whirled around .	1
i heard another crack and i slowly crept towards the noise .	1
another snap sounded , louder this time , to my left .	1
i changed direction and hid behind a tree .	1
i peeked around it .	1
seth grabbed another stick and slammed it into a tree .	1
it hit the tree with a loud crack and broke in half .	1
he picked up another and rammed it again .	1
he went to grab another one but his fingers couldnt grasp it .	1
they shook so hard he dropped it and he sunk to the ground .	1
i saw him place his head under his arms and he curled himself in a tight bundle .	1
he shook and i heard him do something that i thought seth never did .	1
he cried .	1
i stepped out from behind the tree and walked over to him .	1
he didnt hear me , or look up .	1
i wasnt mad at him anymore for not telling me what i wanted to know .	1
now i felt bad that i had nagged him so hard that he was breaking .	1
i walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his body .	1
he stopped crying and i felt him squirm .	1
seth grunted and then mumbled , get off me .	1
no , not until you tell me whats going on , i said .	1
he groaned .	1
seriously jazell , nothing is wrong .	1
now get off me .	1
i rolled my eyes but he couldnt see that .	1
youre a horrible liar seth .	1
i know , i felt him sigh .	1
please jazell its nothing you need to worry about , okay ?	1
just leave me be , i will deal with it .	1
i let my arms fall and seth lifted his head .	1
his eyes were red from crying but something in his eyes showed he was still seth .	1
the same darn stubborn and annoying seth i was friends with .	1
that let me relax a little .	1
he faced me , you should go back to the others .	1
i bet theyre probably wondering no way , i cut in .	1
im not leaving until i get my answer .	1
seth traced the dirt with the end of a stick .	1
you say im stubborn i laughed and he continued , listen , i dont even know if its true or not .	1
theres no need for me to worry any of you .	1
thats why i didnt say anything .	1
i still dont care , seth .	1
i said .	1
he made a face , jazell i really dont know if i should say anything i interrupted him again , seth just give up trying to talk me into not listening .	1
its a waste of breath .	1
i took my own stick and threw it at him .	1
he ducked , of course , and it landed on the ground .	1
what if whatever youre not telling us happens and we never knew ?	1
how would that help anyone ?	1
he looked down and mumbled something that sounded like , you couldnt help .	1
when he looked back up he said , fine you win , ill tell you .	1
he didnt sound happy about it .	1
im waiting .	1
you know , when emily asked for any warnings that we were given ?	1
yeah .	1
i had a bad feeling where this was going .	1
i lied .	1
i blinked in amazement .	1
you lied to emily ?	1
shes going kill you .	1
he smiled faintly .	1
she doesnt need to know .	1
so a dwarf told you something ?	1
why didnt you tell us ?	1
i asked .	1
seth looked away .	1
it didnt actually include you or anyone else , so i did n't say anything .	1
he paused .	1
they said that i would betray you all and be kojas ' servant .	1
i would be the key to the downfall of igneeria .	1
i do n't know what to do jazell ; i do n't even know if those things are true .	1
they wo n't attack me and i swear , if you gave them a minute , i bet they would help me .	1
he was talking so fast the words almost blurred together .	1
i do n't know what to say seth , i said .	1
maybe you should n't worry , maybe they 're wrong .	1
you can control what happens .	1
if you say it wo n't happen , it wo n't .	1
i hope you 're right , he said .	1
me too .	1
the mood was perfect .	1
i saw seth relax a little and the look on his face was more like himself .	1
i was perfectly happy with the way everything was right now until i saw the small outline of a toad dwarf nearby .	1
uh seth i do n't think this is the best time to mention this but i think we have company .	1
i pointed to the shape .	1
he swore under his breath , and we both entered the dwarf 's world together .	1
sure enough , it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf .	1
he just walked toward us as if he was n't afraid that i might put an arrow through his head .	1
just as i was about to release my arrow , the dwarf cried , please stop !	1
i dont know why i listened to him but i didnt pull the string .	1
the dwarf was acting different than the others ; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow .	1
why ?	1
seth growled .	1
your kind has done nothing good to us except make us confused and our lives more complicated .	1
the dwarf looked startled .	1
oh youll have to excuse my brethren ; they have a tendency to be rather annoying .	1
he took a long frightened look at seths sword .	1
good sir , before you try to slay me , i have a message to deliver from her majesty .	1
i lowered my bow because i had a feeling i wanted to know what this message was .	1
if it was a lie , seth and i could kill him anyway in a blink of an eye .	1
seth , maybe we should hear what he has to say .	1
ive had enough of listening to dwarfs , seth hissed .	1
all they bring me is bad news .	1
the dwarf was trembling .	1
oh please , sir , listen to the good lady !	1
i do not bring news that will cause you pain , but i bring news of the pain of others .	1
you must listen , it is my task !	1
seth looked at me and i nodded .	1
he sighed and lowered his weapon to the ground , its tip digging into the dirt .	1
the dwarf relaxed a little , but its body was still full of tension .	1
thank you , sir !	1
he squeaked .	1
her majesty requests that i tell you about youre real destiny .	1
she believes youve been in the dark long enough .	1
what do you mean ?	1
i questioned .	1
our real destiny ?	1
yes , he said , a little more relaxed , it must take place in igneeria , where you are truly needed .	1
my brow furrowed in confusion .	1
but wait , arent we in igneeria right now ?	1
the dwarf gave a quick , half-hearted laugh .	1
no miss , you are far from igneeria .	1
youre in the half-way , the place between earth and igneeria .	1
the half-way can act as a gate , or passage into earth .	1
it seals off the two worlds and if a monster were to make it as far as the half-way , it would have a truly difficult time completing its journey because it wont find a way in or out of this place .	1
so let me get this straight , i said slowly , were not in igneeria right now but some half-way ?	1
the dwarf nodded , happily .	1
so wheres igneeria ?	1
the dwarf rubbed his stubby chin .	1
the entrance changes but its current location is in your town .	1
thats how i got here .	1
but dont get the half-way confused with igneeria , miss , for they are quite different .	1
especially now , with all the dark events that have been occurring because of his rising .	1
you mean kojas ?	1
i asked .	1
shh !	1
not here , not anywhere !	1
he said quickly .	1
never say his name unless youre sure hes not around .	1
his name can summon him or others .	1
you understand , do not say his name !	1
alright , alright i get it !	1
i said .	1
i dont have to be told a million times .	1
now what else do you need to tell us about our destiny .	1
i included air quotes around destiny .	1
he stared at me happily .	1
oh you have to come to igneeria , miss .	1
wow wait , hold it !	1
i held my hands out .	1
buddy , you just show up talking about some destiny that we dont know about and then you say that we have to come to some place thats not here , and you expect us to go ?	1
what about our families and people whod ask questions , if we disappear .	1
what do we say , oh sorry about that everyone , we just felt like leaving earth to go to this magical place called igneeria to do something that we dont know about .	1
well of course , there will be some minor difficulties , he said .	1
minor ?	1
i squeaked .	1
seriously , did you not hear a word i just said ?	1
he placed his pudgy hands on his small hips .	1
miss dont you think that her majesty would have this all planned out ?	1
you dont have to worry .	1
seth twirled his sword .	1
why not , we have to tell our parents something .	1
sir , dont worry about a thing .	1
all you need to do is go home .	1
everything has been arranged .	1
what do you mean , arranged ?	1
seth asked sharply .	1
the dwarf seemed to bounce up and down .	1
it has sir , but i dont know what her majesty did .	1
all i know is that all of you have to go home to get ready .	1
my mind whirled with all this new information .	1
wait , why do we have to go ?	1
what is this destiny ?	1
the dwarf gave a feeble smile .	1
all of you must free our world from darkness , from him .	1
*** seth and i walked back to our clearing , both our brains not thinking .	1
it was too much to take in at once .	1
destroy kojas ?	1
we could barely take on a mass of monsters without dying , so how were we suppose to take down an evil , powerful demon ?	1
as the trees parted away to show the empty ground , i spotted emily and jason looking like they were about to go to war with a bunch of sticks .	1
when they saw us appear , both dropped their weapons and smiled at us .	1
typical cover up .	1
hey seth , it looks like jazell didnt kill you after all , emily said and flashed me a grin .	1
what was that all about anyway , jazell ?	1
i opened my mouth to spill the whole truth when seth glanced at me .	1
i sighed at his expression , knowing that i couldnt tell anyone if seth didnt want me to .	1
i didnt want to make it worse by revealing what i knew .	1
when i didnt reply , she covered her mouth with her hand to try to cover her chuckles .	1
oh then , she giggled , i hope you two had a nice chat .	1
stop it emily !	1
i snapped and felt my face burn .	1
she snickered .	1
okay whatever you say , jazell .	1
we have to tell you guys something , i told her and jason about how the dwarf had showed up and what he said about igneeria .	1
emily listened quietly but when i got to the part that we were supposed to go there , her mouth fell open .	1
thats completely crazy !	1
emily gasped .	1
were supposed to just leave and go there ?	1
what about our parents ?	1
he told me , and i quote , miss did you not think that her majesty would have this all planned out ?	1
you dont have to worry .	1
i personally think its all a little skeptical , dont you ?	1
yes , she said , digging for a pencil and paper from my bag , i do .	1
we dont even know who this majesty is and if this information is reliable .	1
i understand the half-way part , that makes sense , but the destiny part doesnt .	1
i sighed and sat down on the log .	1
the dwarf said to meet him tomorrow morning near the thorn that reaches the sky .	1
what does that mean anyway ?	1
jason stepped over and spoke instead of emily , who was furiously writing everything down , as if shed forget in a couple of seconds , it could be a description of something in town , maybe a building or a landmark .	1
i suddenly got an idea and took another piece of paper out .	1
hey jason maybe you could draw what you think it might be and that would help us .	1
ill try my best , jazell , he said .	1
i knew that his drawing would probably help us .	1
he was the best artist i knew , his artwork was almost real .	1
hey guys , emily piped up from her paper , i think we should get home and speak to our parents .	1
i want to see what this dwarf was talking about when he said that everything was already arranged .	1
i agree .	1
i grabbed my backpack .	1
wait , are we going to go ?	1
seth and jason grinned at me and said together , you bet .	1
that is if we can find the place , emily reminded them .	1
i turned the door knob and walked into the kitchen .	1
my mom and dad were sitting in the living room looking extremely excited .	1
before i even had a chance to say hi , my mom jumped up and rushed over to me .	1
you never told us that you applied for a summer camp !	1
my mom squealed happily .	1
you also didnt tell us that you were to be picked from the best .	1
congratulations !	1
she hugged me .	1
um , i choked out in surprise as i was squeezed , i wanted it to beuha surprise .	1
i managed to get the words out and seem intelligent .	1
my mom released me from her clamp-like hug , well i am surprised , and very proud !	1
thank you ?	1
i said slowly .	1
this must have been the dwarfs plan .	1
would have been nice if he had warned me , i thought bitterly .	1
my dad got up and glowed happily behind my mom .	1
we are very proud , jazell .	1
youre supposed to leave tomorrow , so you better pack .	1
im going to go do that .	1
i said quickly , while i backed up towards the stairs .	1
as soon as i reached them , i shot up so fast you would think i was running for my life .	1
i closed the door , locking it behind me and then dialed emilys cell phone as fast as i could .	1
i sat on my bed as the phone rang three times before i heard it click .	1
jazell you wouldnt believe what my parents just told me .	1
they say i signed up for some camp and- i know the same thing happened to me , i interrupted her quickly .	1
i hear her breathe heavily , this is crazy , its just happening too fast .	1
we have to go or well be in big trouble with our parents .	1
but the thing is we dont know where this meeting place is and- she was cut off by the ringing of my phone .	1
wait a minute emily , ill have to put you on hold .	1
she huffed in reply so i pressed a button and said , hello ?	1
its me , jazell , jasons voice said breathlessly .	1
i know where the meeting place is .	1
great jason , where is it ?	1
i asked .	1
a shuffle of paper sounded as jason moved around .	1
its at the art statue , the one we call the rising hill .	1
its in the park , remember ?	1
of course , when we were younger , we used to try to climb it .	1
i replied .	1
i heard jason chuckle .	1
who could forget ?	1
so i guess ill see you there ?	1
of course , jason , ill tell emily .	1
ill tell seth then .	1
see ya .	1
emilys voice came back .	1
well , who was it ?	1
it was jason , he found the meeting place , i said .	1
its the public art piece we use to climb .	1
that makes sense .	1
she paused .	1
i have to go , dinner .	1
bye emily , i whispered .	1
see you tomorrow .	1
bye .	1
she clicked off .	1
after dinner i was laying in bed , my mind spinning .	1
i still couldnt believe where i was going tomorrow .	1
to igneeria .	1
chapter 6 i opened my eyes the next morning , the suns rays shinning through my bedroom window .	1
i didnt roll out of bed for a minute ; instead i lay staring at the ceiling trying to prepare my brain for the day ahead .	1
i heard my mom and dad walking downstairs , talking excitedly about where they thought i was going to go today .	1
i rolled off my bed and walked sleepily over to my dresser to pull out a pair of jeans and a shirt .	1
after i had pulled the shirt over my head , i grabbed my half empty traveling bag and headed down stairs .	1
i dropped my bag near the door and walked over to the kitchen table .	1
my mom had placed a full plate of eggs and toast on the table ; i sat down and started to eat .	1
my mom hurried over and glanced at her watch .	1
you have about a half an hour until you have to leave .	1
eat up .	1
i responded with a quick shovel of food .	1
within 25 minutes , i was standing by the door with my stomach all queasy .	1
my mom rushed forward and gave me a quick hug .	1
be careful now and enjoy yourself !	1
right i will i said uneasily .	1
no doubt that i was going to be very careful indeed .	1
i stepped outside and the door closed behind me .	1
my mom and dad watched from the window , waving happily to me .	1
i returned a slow , uncertain wave and hurried off towards the park .	1
as i entered the park , i spotted the rising public art statue .	1
the shape twisted and stretched towards the sky , trying to touch it .	1
now that i really thought of it , it did look like a thorn .	1
i dropped my bag and leaned my back against the statue , closing my eyes .	1
i wondered what igneeria would be like .	1
maybe the place would be pretty decent jazell ?	1
emilys voice scattered my thoughts and i opened my eyes to see her walking briskly towards me .	1
she too had an empty bag slung over her shoulder .	1
she dropped her bag next to mine and leaned against the statue .	1
nobody spoke for awhile .	1
finally emily opened her mouth and said , what are you thinking about ?	1
what ?	1
the question had caught me by complete surprise .	1
what are you thinking about ?	1
she repeated .	1
surely you must be thinking something ; were going to some other world !	1
i closed my eyes .	1
i was just wondering what it would be like in igneeria .	1
what about you ?	1
well , she said thoughtfully , i was thinking about kojas- emily dont say his name , i dont feel like being yelled at again .	1
i interrupted her .	1
fine , she said , a little annoyed .	1
i was thinking about him , if i must call him that , and what hes like .	1
i rolled my eyes .	1
emily isnt it obvious ; hes evil for crying out loud .	1
thats why we have to go and stop him .	1
i know that jazell , gosh , but i was wondering what he looks like .	1
i dont want to know , i said .	1
emily twirled her hair , i know but im just curious .	1
i bit my lip .	1
if we do end up fighting this guy , youll get your wish .	1
minutes later , jason emerged from the trees and dropped his travel bag on the ground .	1
he leaned against the statue next to emily , giving us both feeble smiles .	1
so , he said , trying to sound happy , travel day today , huh ?	1
we didnt answer .	1
okay looks like ill do the talking , jason said .	1
you two excited ?	1
emily shook her head .	1
no , jason were both jumping for joy , but its so deep down that instead we both look like we want to slug you , i said sarcastically .	1
jason sighed , okay , you would say something like that .	1
i thought in a mood like this you would be lessannoying .	1
as soon as he finished his sentence , i wacked him as hard as i could .	1
seth showed up after that , placed his bag on the ground , leaned on the statue next to me , and didnt say a word .	1
we all stood there waiting for the dwarf to show up .	1
right as i was about to give up and say we had the wrong place , he appeared .	1
jason saw his blurry outline first and signaled us to enter the half-way .	1
the wind whirled around me , and i walked over to the dwarf with the others .	1
the dwarf was breathing heavily , trying to catch his breath .	1
all four of us stood there waiting and when he got his breath back , he spoke .	1
i am glad that you accepted my message , he said to seth and me .	1
then he turned to emily and jason and said , ah , its great to meet the other two .	1
he beamed at all four of us .	1
hi , emily said , looking a little freaked out .	1
so now that youre here , are we going to get a move on or what ?	1
oh of course , follow me please .	1
he shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue .	1
jason raised an eyebrow .	1
where is he going ?	1
emily sighed .	1
theres only one way to find out .	1
she walked behind the statue .	1
seth , jason , and i followed her .	1
as soon as i was on the other side , i gasped at what i saw .	1
in front of me was an archway .	1
two entwined hooks were mounted on the top .	1
each side was twisted metal that ended in the ground .	1
in the center , two pieces spun together and ended holding a pulsing , black crystal .	1
you should have been able to look right through the archway but there seemed to be a sheet of transparent black glass in the way .	1
this is the door to igneeria , the dwarf pronounced proudly .	1
i fought the urge to say , no duh !	1
jason looked up , mesmerized .	1
epic .	1
epic ?	1
seth scoffed .	1
thats all you can say ?	1
this , he motioned to the dark archway , ca n't be described by one word .	1
i smiled to myself .	1
the old seth seemed to be coming back , which was great .	1
i was getting really tired of quiet , watching seth .	1
then how about the coolest thing on earth ?	1
jason asked .	1
seth shook his head .	1
no , its not even a part of earth .	1
try creepy , but cool .	1
emily rolled her eyes .	1
boys , i still dont know how they find this interesting .	1
she pointed to jason and seth , who were continuing to guess random names to describe the arch .	1
i mean , who cares !	1
am i right about them ?	1
yes , completely , i said and fought a laugh .	1
dont try to understand or youll get lost in the complicated labyrinths that are their brains .	1
i think this is the most thinking the two have ever done , emily said with a sigh and shook her head , making her pink curls dance .	1
its just sad .	1
i was about to say something else when the dwarf gave a loud cough .	1
jason and seth fell silent , outlined by the eerie glow of the arch .	1
you must know a few things before you enter , the dwarf said , pacing back and forth .	1
he reminded me of a teacher instructing a class .	1
first of all , once you enter , there is a chance that you wont be able to leave for a while .	1
my heart fell at this .	1
second , igneeria is wild and offers little protection .	1
especially at a time like this .	1
he gave us a hard stare .	1
you might get seriously injured , or you might almost die .	1
you must be ready for this .	1
i felt my stomach do sick flip-flops .	1
i wasnt ready .	1
anyway , the dwarf said quickly , obviously seeing our surprised faces , i think all of you can deal with that .	1
shall we go ?	1
seth shrugged , i guess .	1
the answer to that question doesnt really matter .	1
the dwarf held his hand out , shall we go then ?	1
i shrugged , lead the way , shorty .	1
the dwarf gave me an annoyed look and walked towards the arch .	1
i expected him to go right through but he disappeared in a swirl of black mist .	1
jason shrugged and ran in after him .	1
wait jason , emily called .	1
dang , never mind .	1
she disappeared too .	1
i went to follow her and hesitated .	1
seth walked up to me , you nervous ?	1
why shouldnt i be ?	1
i said , shaking .	1
is going to a different world supposed to be vacation-relaxing-in-the-sun easy ?	1
he smirked , i never said that .	1
you implied it , i said , with a roll of my eyes .	1
he sighed and pushed me into the doorway , the dark , swirling mist swallowing me up .	1
i felt his hands leave my back for a second and then they were back .	1
the chilly feeling welcomed me , like a long lost friend .	1
as soon as the mist cleared , i was standing in a forest clearing .	1
the sky was hazy and dreary , making me want to run back to earth .	1
but when i turned around , the door was gone .	1
emily looked terrified , her eyes bigger than the eerie moon above .	1
jason was frozen next to her , eyes darting around at the shadows .	1
the dwarf stood perfectly calm in front of us .	1
no one spoke because there was nothing to say .	1
i heard rustling in the trees and dozens of creatures came thundering out .	1
i noticed thrashers , frost beasts , swamp trolls and many others i have never seen .	1
they lumbered towards us , teeth flashing in the moon light .	1
seth whirled around on the dwarf .	1
you set us up !	1
he hissed , sword drawn .	1
this was all a trap !	1
the dwarf 's eyes widened in alarm , i swear , sir , that i knew nothing of this !	1
i warned you that you must be prepared for anything .	1
seth , i said slowly , placing a hand on his shoulder , do n't attack him , we need him to help us get through igneeria .	1
i felt his shoulder muscle tense under my fingers but he lowered his blade .	1
he did n't sheath it though , because he would need it in the fight .	1
he glowered at the dwarf , do n't think that i trust you , dwarf , he said angrily .	1
you 're only alive because jazell makes a good point .	1
but if i find that you are lying to us , he sliced the air , you 're going to have a lot more problems than you think .	1
the dwarf gulped and looked away .	1
i gripped seth 's shoulder and he turned around to face me .	1
i saw distrust flash in his eyes but he gave me a weak smile .	1
we turned to face the monsters heading for us .	1
seth charged ahead , slicing thrashers and frost beasts .	1
i notched an arrow and released it .	1
it soared into a swamp toll 's head , making it shout out in agony .	1
seth spun around and plunged his sword into the troll 's side .	1
it gave a screech and fell to the floor , dead .	1
emily raised her hands and vines shot from the ground and wrapped around a troll that had tried to crush seth .	1
i aimed an arrow at its chest and the troll fell to the ground next to the others .	1
the last beast fell , dead from jason 's knife , and we all took in a deep breath .	1
seth sheathed his sword and i slung my bow back on my back .	1
emily sat on the ground next to jason , seth and me as the dwarf stood in front of us .	1
sadly , he started , i can not be with you all anymore .	1
i must leave and go back to her ...	1
wait a minute !	1
seth exclaimed , jumping up .	1
you 're leaving us ?	1
you little ... seth !	1
i protested and stepped in front of him .	1
do n't you dare think about killing him .	1
he got us here- and he 's leaving us here in some random place when we have no clue what to do or where we 're going , seth interrupted me .	1
the dwarf shook his head .	1
i 'm very sorry , sir , but her majesty told me to bring you here and then to report back .	1
i must tell her about the ambush , someone knew i was bringing you here .	1
do n't you have to bring us to her ?	1
seth asked .	1
the dwarf cocked his head .	1
no , she will see you when she believes you are ready , he turned around and disappeared into the woods .	1
wait !	1
i yelled and ran after him .	1
wait , jazell , seth called after me and i heard him follow .	1
the trees parted and the dwarf stood in front of me .	1
he gave me a small smile .	1
i do wish you luck , miss .	1
i hope you survive .	1
please help us , i begged .	1
we need your help .	1
he shook his head .	1
i 'm very sorry , miss , but i ca n't .	1
he gave me another smile and was gone .	1
jazell , i heard emily say .	1
i turned around to see her smiling at me .	1
we 'll be fine .	1
emily 's right , seth said .	1
we do n't need him .	1
if he does n't want to help us then it 's his fault if we do n't get where we need to go .	1
we should find somewhere to stay for the night , jason suggested .	1
seth nodded and we followed him deeper into the dark woods .	1
i walked beside emily as the trees passed us .	1
things seemed to watch us from the shadows and i felt like some poor little kid who was afraid to be a victim of a halloween jump-out-of-the-bush scare trick .	1
i shivered in silent fear .	1
emily studied me , are you cold ?	1
do you need to get warmed up ?	1
a little flame of fire flickered to life in her palm .	1
i gave a shaky laugh .	1
no , i 'm not that kind of cold .	1
she put the little flame out .	1
ah , i know what you mean , she said and hugged me .	1
i 'm feeling the same way .	1
but do n't worry , they , she motioned to the boys , do n't have to know .	1
they 'll find out eventually , i mumbled .	1
but that does n't have to been now .	1
i bet they must have some kind of fear themselves .	1
i shivered .	1
it 's like going throw the bogey-man 's home .	1
he must not get a lot of visitors , emily commented .	1
i 'm defiantly not coming over anytime soon .	1
emily laughed and the boys stopped walking .	1
the trees parted to reveal a rock ledge .	1
i spotted a small cave , the entrance covered in thick , twisted bramble .	1
the sky was getting even darker and more ominous when seth turned around to face us .	1
we 'll head for the cave and stay there for the night , seth said .	1
then we 'll set off .	1
emily crossed her arms .	1
who made you in charge ?	1
you have a better idea , emily ?	1
seth snorted .	1
or maybe you 'd prefer to sleep in the open .	1
uh i think i 'll stay with that plan , she said quickly .	1
but you 're a grump seth .	1
she pushed past him and headed the path to the cave .	1
you are , seth , i said .	1
i followed emily , with jason and seth on my heels .	1
when we reached the blocked cave entrance , seth drew his sword and sliced the vines apart .	1
they fell to the ground and the cave was revealed .	1
we walked inside the dimly lit space and i sighed in relief at some safety .	1
the air smelled musty and i had a feeling no one had ever been here .	1
i sat on the floor next to emily and the boys sat on the opposite side of the floor .	1
we should all get some rest , seth said with a yawn .	1
we can figure out what to do next when we wake up .	1
i nodded sleepily and laid down on the hard ground .	1
i closed my eyes , feeling a strange tiredness come over me .	1
i barely heard seth mumbled , i do n't like our situation at all .	1
that night , i had the weirdest dream .	1
i was standing on a dark cliff , the eerie moon high in the sky .	1
the wind whipped at my hair , causing me to see the green strands in front of my eyes .	1
the cold nipped at my cheeks and nose , which i tried to rub back to warmth .	1
i stood at the edge of the cliff and gasped when i looked down .	1
underneath me , hundreds of monsters gathered around a fight .	1
i couldnt see who was fighting inside because a swamp troll blocked my view , but i knew it was brutal the way they whooped at a screech of pain .	1
i wanted to close my eyes and look away , but i was so curious to see what was going on , that i couldnt .	1
the crowd parted to reveal the scariest and most hideous thing ive ever seen .	1
it must have been some type of faery because i could see long , pointed ears sticking up from the sides of its head .	1
long , black hair was stuck out in all directions on top of its head looking slimy and dirty .	1
sharp , twisted horns sat on top of its head , gleaming in the dark .	1
a long , billowing black cloak spiraled out behind it , completely covering the rest of its body .	1
its eyes shined red and full of hate , although there was a terrible smile that danced on its face .	1
victory !	1
it boomed in a chilling voice .	1
the crowds of monsters roared in applause and excitement .	1
the trolls banged their clubs on the ground , on their chests , and even on each other .	1
the howl of a frost beast rose into the night , making me feel even more chilled .	1
i wanted to wake up .	1
but i couldnt .	1
i needed to find out what that thing was and what it had killed .	1
i also had a horrible feeling , deep down that made me know that this wasnt a dream but some type of vision .	1
this was happening in real life , right now in igneeria .	1
that proved that igneeria had worse things to hide than what we thought was bad .	1
the thing walked forward and the crowd parted to make it a path , falling silent .	1
i find myself creeping back until i could barely see the scene below .	1
i was afraid that it would see me .	1
then i got a glimpse of what it had killed and i had to hold back my tears .	1
the poor body of the dwarf who had brought us here was lying in a contorted heap , limbs twisted in all directions .	1
the scene was awful and i had to prevent myself from throwing up .	1
then i knew why they beat and killed him .	1
all the other dwarves were on kojas .	1
this dwarf must have betrayed kojas to bring information to whoever her majesty was and to help us into igneeria .	1
i suddenly knew that this dwarf was much braver than we had given him credit for .	1
i suddenly felt awful because i knew who the thing was .	1
kojas .	1
chapter 7 the little traitor thought he could fool us , kojas announced , but he was wrong .	1
his death does not matter to me but what matters is what he could have said and done against us .	1
he may have spilled too much .	1
but it does not matter !	1
he continued , his voice flowing with reassurance .	1
i have knowledge that the half-lings have entered our world and our grasp .	1
the dwarf may have done us a favor , bringing them here , without knowing it .	1
my help , my prize travels with them .	1
he will bring us to victory , the half-ling boy !	1
the crowd roared louder than ever , fueled by the thought of victory .	1
anger rose inside me with every word kojas said .	1
seth would not help them and the dwarf did n't make a mistake .	1
the only one making the mistake was kojas .	1
the crowd fell silent as he said , we will find them and kill them .	1
than nothing will be in our way !	1
my disbelief grew and a single howl sounded above all .	1
i felt the ground disappear underneath me as i woke up to the safety of the cave .	1
i opened my eyes and had to squint because the light was so strong .	1
i sat up and leaned against the wall , looking around .	1
the sun shone brightly through the cave 's entrance , making dirt particles appear in the air .	1
seth was leaning on the wall , twirling his sword in the dirt , not appearing to notice that i was awake .	1
emily and jason were sitting in the center of the cave , playing some kind of hand game .	1
jason hit emily in the arm and she started yelling at .	1
so , this is typical thing to wake up to .	1
i stood up and walked over to seth .	1
he looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face .	1
what 's wrong , jazell ?	1
i need to speak to you , i said in a low voice , alone .	1
seth nodded in understanding and i followed him out of the cave .	1
we stood off to the side near the edge of the cliff where emily and jason could n't see us .	1
for a minute , i did n't say anything because i did n't know what to say .	1
i hesitated , but knew that if i told anyone about the dream , it would be seth .	1
so what was the point in waiting ?	1
i had a dream last night , i began .	1
only it was n't really a dream , but more of a vision .	1
seth nodded .	1
what was it about ?	1
i told him about the cliff and how kojas had killed the dwarf .	1
i hesitated but told him what kojas said about him too , and i saw him stiffen .	1
i 'm sorry , i found myself saying .	1
seth shook his head .	1
it 's not your fault that he said those things about me .	1
i 'm happy you did n't try to keep it from me .	1
what should we do ?	1
i asked desperately .	1
well we know that the dwarf is dead and that kojas knows we 're here , seth said .	1
we also know he 's going to be looking for all of us .	1
so ?	1
so ?	1
seth mimicked and smiled .	1
we do what we always do .	1
we 'll just step up our game and do a little more running than we 're used to .	1
no problem , right ?	1
ya , i said , feeling the fear creep up again .	1
no problem .	1
jazell , it 's okay to be scared , seth looked me in the eye .	1
i 'll admit to you , only you , that i 'm scared too .	1
no , i said with mock surprise .	1
you ?	1
scared ?	1
never .	1
he gave me a light shove .	1
hey smarty pants do n't be sarcastic with me .	1
i just gave you a huge secret .	1
i laughed and shoved him back , do n't tell me what to do , bossy .	1
well , he teased , at least i 'm not going around making fun of friends who are scared .	1
i opened my mouth to say something smart when i heard a small , ahem , at the cave entrance .	1
i looked over my shoulder to see emily standing there , leaning against the rock wall , smiling in a way that made you happy ... but scared .	1
i mentally braced myself for whatever was coming from my eavesdropping friend .	1
so , she said casually , what are you guys talking loudly about ?	1
uh ... was all my brain could compute .	1
luckily seth saved me .	1
what 's wrong with two crazy , half-ling kids going outside in the morning because they 're both tired of listening to their other two friends bicker while they play hand games ?	1
well , you know it 's weird that you two are talking alone , without letting the rest of us know what it is , she shot back .	1
unless you two are hiding something from us ?	1
nice save , seth .	1
um ...	1
i said .	1
why would we hide anything from you two ?	1
emily put her hands on her hips .	1
i do n't know , but you two are acting like you are hiding something .	1
she stopped and gave me a wicked smile .	1
unless you two were not talking- god no , emily !	1
i interrupted her .	1
no way , we were just trying to get away from you two because i just woke up and you guys are really loud first thing in the morning .	1
she sighed .	1
fine , do n't bite my head off jazell , i was just asking a question .	1
then she turned and disappeared back in the cave .	1
seth let out a huge breath .	1
wow , i 'm glad she left .	1
i had the feeling that she knew we were hiding something .	1
he hunched over me .	1
because we are .	1
do you think we should tell them about my vision ?	1
i asked .	1
he chewed his lip in frustration .	1
maybe we should , but not include the parts about me .	1
seth , i said slowly hoping he did n't get mad at me , we should tell them what 's going on with you eventually .	1
what if kojas comes for you and they have no clue why- no !	1
he said sharply , and the tone of his voice surprised me .	1
i ca n't jazell , i would n't have told you if you had n't ran after me demanding to know what i was hiding .	1
but you 're happy i did , right ?	1
i asked .	1
he looked away .	1
yes i am .	1
it 's a lot better than hiding this on my own .	1
the secret just keeps getting bigger .	1
i rolled my eyes .	1
emily will find out eventually , and when she does , she 'll kill you for keeping a secret from her .	1
let 's hope it is n't until you and i figure this thing out .	1
i nodded and walked back into the cave .	1
emily and jason watched us enter and i swallowed nervously .	1
seth gave me a small nod , signaling me to start telling them about my dream .	1
listen guys , i had a dream , i said and repeated my dream again , minus the part about seth .	1
emily and jason listened to every word i said .	1
when i got to the part about kojas , emily 's mouth made a small o and jason 's eyes widened .	1
my voice shook as i recalled the dwarf 's dead body .	1
that 's awful !	1
emily said , her voice shaking .	1
she hopped over and gave me a small embrace .	1
i 'm sorry you had to see that .	1
uh ... thanks emily , i said and allowed myself to be hugged .	1
she bounced back over to jason 's side and waited for me to continue but there was nothing else to say .	1
i had told her everything i needed to tell her .	1
did she somehow know that i was n't telling her the whole story ?	1
i looked at seth out of the corner of my eye and saw him doing the same .	1
we needed to talk longer and more in depth about the situation we were sharing .	1
so , emily said and tapped her fingers on the cave wall , is that all ?	1
yes .	1
well then , she looked us in the eyes , what are we waiting for ?	1
let 's get a move on and leave this small , damp cave .	1
i shrugged and followed her out .	1
the sky was lit but still had a gloomy feeling mixed in with the warmth .	1
i felt a sense of dread as we entered the never-ending forest again .	1
a few rays fought their way through the thick canopy of trees , making it possible to see what was around you .	1
seth led the way as we followed a faint path through the unknown .	1
i was bringing up the rear of the line , emily in front of me .	1
i watched her cloak swish around her ankles , the rhythm surprisingly soothing to me .	1
the silence was unnatural , and i felt like there should be some kind of sound .	1
i should n't have thought that .	1
out of nowhere i heard a single rattle .	1
then it suddenly stopped .	1
a feeling of unease rose inside of me but i kept walking .	1
then another rattle that did n't end sounded , vibrating all around us .	1
another seemed to join it , then another and another until the noise was unbearably loud .	1
sick , quiet laughter sounded all around us .	1
it giggled and laughed in amusement , shrieking at us .	1
the laughter stopped , but the rattle did n't .	1
but whatever it was , it surrounded us .	1
the four of us pressed together .	1
this is the prey ?	1
a rake-like voice cackled .	1
this is nothing !	1
i saw seth draw his sword and the rest of us readied our weapons .	1
i gripped my bow so hard that i was afraid it might break in two .	1
i heard more screechy laughter .	1
easy kill , another agreed .	1
no challenge , something else piped up .	1
the king under estimates our abilities .	1
it laughed .	1
a voice hissed , we will show him .	1
this was seriously starting to freak me out .	1
it was like the dead were talking to me , and i shivered .	1
then i saw them .	1
they slithered from the shadows of the trees and bushes .	1
there hundreds of them , each easily my height .	1
they were covered in black , grey green scales that were each the size of my hand .	1
they were layered on its body like plated armor .	1
their beady dark , red eyes sent shivers down my spine .	1
i slung my bow back over my shoulder and grabbed my hunter 's knife from its sheath on my side .	1
one stopped and raised its head up towards me .	1
it opened its mouth to reveal rows of sharp , yellow fangs .	1
a chuckle escaped its mouth .	1
what are you going to do with that , half-ling ?	1
it said with a voice that sent needles into my skin .	1
a knife wo n't do a thing against something like me .	1
i almost listened to the thing and started to lower my weapon but i caught myself .	1
my hands started to shake .	1
its eyes glistened with hunger .	1
you ca n't even hold a weapon .	1
so how are you going to save your friends ?	1
i did n't know what it was talking about until i looked over .	1
seth was stiff and frozen , his eyes following one of the snake creatures that was climbing its way up his leg .	1
it twisted itself around his arm and brushed onto his neck .	1
seth swung his sword at the back of the snake but there was a flash and it sliced his arm instead .	1
he winced and dropped his weapon .	1
the snake had wrapped around his neck and was squeezing .	1
i gripped my knife but stopped when the creature snickered from the ground .	1
i would n't do that if i were you , it said .	1
that would n't be wise .	1
why ?	1
i demanded .	1
it would n't be right to help seth ?	1
it hissed in laughter .	1
no , half-ling .	1
if you have n't realized it yet , we change our shapes .	1
your friend already hurt himself learning that .	1
seth was n't looking so good .	1
he was bent over and was grabbing at his neck .	1
i then realized that the snake was now a smaller brown colored snake and had its whole body wrapped completely around his neck .	1
i had an awful feeling that i could n't help seth without hurting him .	1
i was helpless .	1
emily and jason were farther off fighting their own swarm .	1
i could see from here that they were slowly losing too .	1
emily continued to try to fry the creatures or knock them away with air , but it was n't really working .	1
i kept seeing jason 's knives fly off into the woods , or sink into the ground , instead of hitting their mark .	1
and now half-ling , it whispered with joy , you die .	1
it lunged up at me .	1
i had a sudden feeling inside and i stabbed at the creature .	1
it tried to change forms to avoid the knife 's path but somehow my knife stabbed it anyway .	1
it withered and then went still .	1
i gasped as the body fell to the ground and even some of the creatures , around stopped .	1
they murmured among each other , she killed a syphon !	1
she killed one of us .	1
so the awful creatures were called syphons ?	1
what did they want ?	1
i made a mental note to tell emily about this .	1
that is , if all of us didnt die first .	1
they screeched in anger and i felt their eyes on me .	1
every single one was full of burning hatred .	1
but i ignored the feeling and focused on seth .	1
his eyes locked on mine as he wheezed and he sent me a clear message , help .	1
not that i needed his permission anyway , it 's just seth never asked for help .	1
i , again , suddenly knew the syphon 's weakness but i did n't know why or how .	1
i could sense some dark black area on the neck just like a target dot .	1
i stabbed it and the creature gave a dying hiss , falling to the ground too .	1
seth rubbed his neck and grabbed his sword .	1
thanks jazell .	1
no problem , i said .	1
want to rescue the others ?	1
seth grinned , sure , jason is n't going to be happy about me saving his butt .	1
well he can deal , i said and walked quickly towards emily and jason .	1
we better hurry .	1
i reached emily in a few , quick strides , stabbing some syphons that were trying to attack her .	1
she looked up at me and opened her mouth to ask me how the heck i did that but i shook my head .	1
i 'd explain the unexplainable later .	1
aim for the neck !	1
i shouted to the both of them .	1
it 's their weak point .	1
they both nodded in agreement .	1
jason spun around and began to stab them as i suggested .	1
he ducked and i say their number start to drop because of his quick reflexes .	1
the swarm 's size was reduced to half .	1
the syphons were starting to look uneasy , hesitating before they flung themselves at us .	1
it did n't matter to me .	1
retreat !	1
one of the voices yelled .	1
fall back !	1
they gave one more angry hiss at us and disappeared into the woods .	1
the bushes and trees rattled and then the woods were silent .	1
i could hear everyone 's heavy breaths as we turned to face each other .	1
well , actually everyone turned to me .	1
so , i said and wiped the sweat off my knife 's handle , that was something , was n't it ?	1
emily put her hands on her hips .	1
jazell , how the heck did you know how to kill those things ?	1
she shook her head .	1
what were those things ?	1
syphons , i said .	1
i do n't know how i knew where to stab them .	1
i just did , alright ?	1
it was weird .	1
seth shook his head and leaned against a tree .	1
how come you get some random power when the rest of us do n't ?	1
he gave me a fake pout .	1
it 's not fair .	1
i leaned against the tree next to him and rammed my elbow into his side .	1
he winced and i grinned .	1
i did n't ask for the power , seth .	1
but it did save our butts so i 'm happy , i magically gained it .	1
well i hope i get some cool power too , emily said and stretched .	1
whatever , jason said and twirled a knife in his hand .	1
he seemed to go back to say-a-few-words-and-then-say-nothing-which-drives-everyone-crazy .	1
emily made a face at him .	1
wow , thanks so much for the support , jason .	1
that speech was incredible .	1
jason stuck his tongue out .	1
you 're welcome .	1
one day , she mumbled .	1
one darn day ... emily , are you okay ?	1
i asked .	1
her head shot up and she gave me a big smile .	1
yup , never better .	1
i 'm just having a minute to myself .	1
okay ...	1
i trailed off .	1
seth walked over to join us .	1
we should get moving and find somewhere else to stay .	1
if we stay and argue in the forest , something worse is bound to find us .	1
right , lead the way , i said and pushed off the tree .	1
seth nodded and i walked beside him as he led us , once again , through the woods .	1
emily and jason were talking quietly about something which gave us both the opportunity to talk .	1
you think kojas sent them ?	1
i mumbled to him and pushed a branch away .	1
he looked at me from the corner of his eye .	1
obviously , why else would they say that the 'king ' would underestimate them ?	1
you make a good point , i said .	1
why did the syphon attack you ?	1
i lowered my voice so only he could hear me .	1
i thought you said they would n't attack you .	1
he looked uneasy .	1
the syphon said he would be rewarded for grabbing me .	1
i think he was n't trying to kill me but trying to knock me out .	1
so he could bring you to kojas .	1
he nodded but he seemed somewhere else .	1
he sighed and said , i hope they wo n't go too far to achieve that , or it 'll get harder to hide this from emily and jason .	1
i crossed my arms .	1
i told you that we should tell them .	1
but you still refuse to let me- no , he said sternly .	1
no and that 's that .	1
fine , i said and threw my arms in the air .	1
i give up .	1
at least i tried but you 're just too stinking stubborn .	1
seth flashed me a smile .	1
it 's what you love the most about me .	1
i punched him in the arm .	1
who said i loved anything about you .	1
maybe i like puppies more .	1
at least they listen , mostly .	1
ow , that hurts , he said and clutched his side .	1
i laughed and felt the world brighten a bit .	1
you 're so annoying .	1
you can add that to the list .	1
you just love to insult me , seth grinned .	1
is it your new hobby ?	1
it will be if you keep annoying me , i fought the urge to punch him again .	1
he just rolled his eyes at me .	1
he really is the most annoying person i 've ever met besides emily and myself .	1
wow , he was going to have us both beat .	1
i 'm sorry to interrupt your playful banter , but are we actually looking for a place in particular or just some random cave ?	1
emily 's annoyed voice asked us from behind .	1
yes , just a random cave or a place to stay .	1
why ?	1
seth asked , just as annoyed .	1
well , she said , a cave wo n't be found in a forest , so should n't we be finding a way out of the forest ?	1
i know that , emily , he said and pointed to the trees .	1
can you find a way out ?	1
it just goes on and on .	1
i 'm hoping that we find a clearing soon .	1
fine , she said and crossed her arms , i 'm sorry i interrupted your conversation .	1
then she started talking to jason again .	1
seth made a cat noise and clawed the air , someone 's a pussy cat today .	1
be quiet seth or she 'll hurt you , i said and looked over my shoulder .	1
emily seemed to have heard that and she winked at me .	1
i smiled and winked back .	1
seth i 'd be really careful .	1
seth snorted , i 'm not scared of her .	1
i would be , i said and had to fight another smile .	1
i could tell it was getting past noon because the air started to get cooler .	1
i was suddenly really jealous of emily 's long robe .	1
i also was getting hungry and wondered if there was any way to get food in igneeria .	1
a huge rumble startled me and i looked up at the sky .	1
we were in a clearing and i could see the sky clearly .	1
dark clouds covered the sky and a rumble shook the air again .	1
a single drop of water landed on my cheek .	1
oh no , i breathed .	1
another drop landed on my forehead and then on my chin .	1
then they started to pick up speed and i covered my face with my hands .	1
the rain streaked through my hair , soaking it to my head .	1
seth looked extremely annoyed as he stood there , his blue hair plastered to his face .	1
his eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine .	1
he rolled his eyes and looked away .	1
jason had his arms over his head , trying to keep the rain off his red hair but i already saw dark spots all over it where the rain had escaped his arms .	1
emily 's pink hair was dry and safely under a hood .	1
wait , what ?	1
emily , how come you have a hood ?	1
i had to shout over the rain .	1
she gave me a dazzling smile .	1
i 'm always prepared .	1
this is just great , seth shouted .	1
we better find some shelter because the rest of us are getting soaked to the bone .	1
i 'll take the lead , i said and ran in front of him .	1
you 'll lead us into a dragon 's cave if you take the lead .	1
seth rolled his eyes again .	1
fine !	1
i walked through the trees and took a right .	1
the trees parted and the trees ended .	1
right ahead of me was a cave .	1
found a cave , that was n't too hard seth , i said .	1
right , he said .	1
so what are we waiting for ?	1
let 's go !	1
i ran towards the cave , eager to get out of the rain and into somewhere dry .	1
i stopped in front to catch my breath .	1
emily , jason , and seth ran up behind me and we stared into the cave .	1
i took a deep breath and started to enter the cave .	1
all of a sudden , a roar made me freeze .	1
two nostrils and eyes popped up from the cave .	1
my blood stopped .	1
it was a dragon .	1
chapter 8 i stood , frozen in fear at the sight of the dragon .	1
it stalked towards me .	1
the piercing green eyes bore into mine and i was more scared than i had ever been in all 15 years of my life .	1
jazell move !	1
seth yelled and pushed me behind him so hard , i almost fell over .	1
i caught myself and pulled out my bow , notching an arrow .	1
we all tensed , prepared for a fight .	1
all of a sudden , emily walked towards the dragon .	1
seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him .	1
she stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth , bizarre sounds started coming out .	1
we all stood there mesmerized as she grunted , growled , snorted and hissed at the dragon .	1
i expected it to just take a huge bite out of her , but it seemed as surprised as we were .	1
emily , what 's going on ?	1
i shouted to her and started to walk over .	1
seth reached out and grabbed my arm .	1
i spun around , suddenly annoyed .	1
he shook his head and nodded over to the dragon .	1
i looked and to my surprise it was bending down to let emily stroke its head .	1
she patted its head and it curled up outside the cave .	1
she bent down to whisper something in its ear and then stood up again .	1
well , she said looking at us , what are you waiting for ?	1
she disappeared in the cave .	1
then she poked her head out .	1
come on !	1
we walked slowly into the cave .	1
i glanced over at the dragon , which was now asleep and making small puffs of smoke in the rain .	1
i sat on the cold stone floor , shivering .	1
i was soaked to the skin and my hair was completely plastered to my head .	1
seth sat next to me and i could see he was shivering too .	1
jason slid down the wall across from us with his eyes closed .	1
i never want to walk again , he mumbled .	1
never .	1
you 're going to have to , dude .	1
we have a lot of walking left to do , seth said wearily .	1
jason groaned and circled up against the wall .	1
emily pulled her hood off and examined herself .	1
she mumbled something and squeezed her sleeves .	1
i feel so heavy and gross .	1
jason 's eyes popped open .	1
why are you complaining ?	1
you 're freaking dryer than all of us and you got some awesome power , too .	1
you ca n't complain .	1
language jason , she scolded .	1
i hate even being a tad wet so i feel like complaining .	1
i just do , so deal .	1
jason scowled and closed his eyes again .	1
i 'm sleeping and if anyone wakes me up and it 's not to kill something , i 'll stab them with my dagger .	1
wow you 're just a sparkly rainbow today , i said .	1
emily shook her head .	1
he 's just a fat crab .	1
maybe i am , jason said , deal .	1
emily sat near the entrance of the cave .	1
i heard jason 's breathing slow down which met he was sleeping .	1
i found myself pressing my shoulder to seth 's , trying to find warmth .	1
heat flowed into my shoulder but it was n't much .	1
oh well , you ca n't always be satisfied .	1
emily , how did you keep that dragon from attacking us ?	1
i asked .	1
you were making funny sounds that made no sense to me .	1
she looked puzzled .	1
what do you mean , i was speaking english and so was the dragon .	1
i shook my head .	1
no you were n't , you were making grunting and growling sounds .	1
that 's odd , i did n't think i was , she said .	1
i told the dragon that we were four half-lings who needed shelter from the rain .	1
then he asked if we were against kojas and i said yes , that he was hunting us .	1
then he told me that he would let us use his cave because he was on our side .	1
then i thanked him and here we are , inside the cave nice and dry .	1
maybe that 's your power , you can speak to dragons , seth suggested .	1
but i do n't understand how you two get powers and we do n't .	1
be patient , i said .	1
yes , emily murmured and stifled a yawn .	1
girls first , seth .	1
have a problem with that ?	1
all right then , he said and leaned against the wall .	1
sweet dreams to you two .	1
yup sweet dreams to us , i said and closed my eyes .	1
goodnight emily .	1
goodnight jazell .	1
i drifted off , feeling surprising comfy against seth 's shoulder and hearing jason softy snore .	1
i opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods .	1
the sky saw clearer and it was n't raining anymore .	1
it was eerie quiet and as i stood there it felt like i had never left the woods .	1
i heard a voice whispering one word over and over again .	1
jazell ... what ?	1
i called .	1
what do you want ?	1
jazell ... the voice whispered again .	1
jazell .	1
what ?	1
i screamed into the trees .	1
what do you want ?	1
why do you have to repeat my name over and over again , it 's creepy .	1
jazell , beware , it whispered again .	1
beware .	1
i stomped my foot in frustration and yelled , beware of what ?	1
beware , it mumbled back .	1
beware of the shadows .	1
what ?	1
i said , startled .	1
i know how scary shadows are and i do n't need you to tell me that .	1
jazell ... that 's it , i said angrily .	1
i 'm getting an answer for once .	1
i ran towards the voice , which was hard because it sounded like it was everywhere .	1
a bright light flashed and i saw a ghost-like girl disappear in the darkness .	1
my eyes widened as i saw seth and then darkness .	1
but not before the voice said one more thing .	1
beware of each other .	1
*** i opened my eyes and shot up so fast my head collided with seth 's .	1
i clutched my head and said , ow .	1
seth stretched his arm to rub his eyes .	1
what 's wrong ?	1
he asked .	1
i shook my head .	1
nothing .	1
i looked at the beads of sweat on his forehead .	1
what 's wrong with you ?	1
nothing , he said .	1
i 'm just hot because when someone sleeps on someone else , that person kind of gets hot .	1
what do you mean ?	1
he shook his arm .	1
you fell asleep leaning against my arm .	1
were you cold ?	1
my face went red .	1
i did n't mean to , sorry .	1
it 's not a problem , at least no one was cold , he said .	1
i need to tell you something , i said .	1
i had another dream and i saw you in it .	1
it was kind of spooky , actually .	1
really , he said .	1
you were in my dream too .	1
there was a voice calling my name , i said , remembering the creepy dream .	1
it was saying to beware of the shadows .	1
then i saw this ghost-like girl before i saw you .	1
then i woke up .	1
seth nodded .	1
mine was calling my name too and said to beware of the shadows .	1
but i saw a ghost-like boy instead .	1
then i saw a glimpse of you and then i woke up .	1
who do you think they were ?	1
i asked .	1
the ghost kids .	1
i do n't know but i have a feeling that they were n't on kojas ' side , he replied .	1
i glanced over at emily and jason , making sure they were still sleeping .	1
why do you think they were in our dreams ?	1
was the 'beware of the shadows ' that important ?	1
does any of this ever make sense to us ?	1
seth asked with a shrug .	1
we just wait it out like we always do .	1
emily groaned and stretched .	1
she opened her eyes , squinting at the two of us .	1
morning .	1
good morning emily , sleep well ?	1
i asked , wondering if she had the same type of dream as we did .	1
she shrugged .	1
i slept soundly , why ?	1
nothing , just curious .	1
okay , she stood up and tip toed towards jason .	1
now the best part , waking up the grump .	1
she bent over close to his ear .	1
she took in a deep breath and then yelled at the top of her lungs , pie !	1
jason jumped up so fast that emily had to jump back to avoid getting hit in the head .	1
he almost fell backward but he steadied himself against the wall .	1
one of his knives slid into his hand but by the time he realized what was going on , we were all laughing hard i was getting the hiccups .	1
jason panted out each word , that ... is ... not ... funny !	1
he glared at emily so hard she must of thought that he had laser eyes .	1
emily was holding herself and trying to stop laughing so she could speak .	1
i 'm sorry jason ... but you were such a grouch yesterday ... we had to get you back !	1
i will get you back , jason said angrily .	1
i will .	1
okay jason , i hiccupped .	1
but you 're going to have to wait a while .	1
dude that was hilarious , seth choked out and had a smile on his face the size of the cave .	1
i 'm surprised you did n't scream like a little girl .	1
but you did jump like one .	1
jason 's face went red .	1
i thought i 'd get some support from you , seth .	1
he crossed his arms .	1
you might be next , you know .	1
seth shrugged .	1
maybe , but i do n't care .	1
we all need a good laugh to keep our spirits up and if that means scaring the crap out of me , i 'm fine with it .	1
so you 'll be fine with me dragging you outside while you were sleeping and leaving you in the rain ?	1
emily asked .	1
seth narrowed his eyes .	1
no , i 'd be cold , wet and annoyed .	1
you can do that if you feel like having me be grouchy all day .	1
nah , emily said .	1
i do n't think it would be worth it .	1
are we just going to sit here and talk or are we going to get a move on ?	1
i asked .	1
alright then , emily said and walked out of the cave .	1
if you want to go in the dreary woods so bad , we 'll go .	1
jason walked after her , shoulders hunched .	1
i went to follow him when seth said , we should tell them about our dreams .	1
i turned around and faced him .	1
we should , they need to know in case they have ones like ours .	1
seth nodded and followed me as we joined everyone else outside .	1
emily waited for us and then headed into the woods .	1
she waved to the dragon and we disappeared once more .	1
i stared off into the trees , waiting for seth 's cue to tell them about the ghost kids .	1
seth raised his hand , signaling for us to stop .	1
he put a finger to his lips and pointed in front of him .	1
i crept up and peered at where he was pointing .	1
a bunch of dwarves and tall , muscular men crowded around something .	1
the men had double swords sheathed on their back , long ears , and long black hair .	1
they were wearing some type of combat boots and thick coats .	1
one of them moved and i saw a tied dragon staked to the ground .	1
it continued to try to stand but it seemed to weak and fell back down .	1
i heard emily gasp in horror and i felt the same way .	1
one of the men poked it in the side with the butt of his sword and the dragon grunted in pain .	1
i looked over my shoulder at emily .	1
she looked like she was about to start crying any second .	1
seth drew his sword and crouched down .	1
he shuffled forward and motioned for us to follow .	1
we slid through the trees as quietly as we could .	1
i kept my eye on the faery men , waiting for one of them to turn around and notice us hiding in the trees .	1
i ducked behind a tree and looked over just in time to see emily trip and fall out of her bush .	1
the faery and dwarves looked at her in surprise .	1
i guess theyve never seen a teenage half-ling girl fall out of a bush before .	1
am i interrupting something ?	1
emily asked with a gulp .	1
the faery men drew their double swords and charged at her .	1
i released an arrow and it buried itself in one of their necks .	1
it fell backward and they turned to my hiding spot , searching for me .	1
two knives flew and a dwarf and man collapsed on the ground .	1
i saw jason hide behind his tree again .	1
one dwarf got too close to emily and she raised her arms , dousing him in flames .	1
he screeched and fell to the ground , withering and then went still .	1
seth ran from the trees , brandishing his sword .	1
he swung it around and clashed with one of the faery 's swords .	1
the faery brought the other around and seth twisted to avoid it .	1
he grabbed the blade and flung it out of the man 's arms .	1
he roared angrily and threw his sword down on seth , who raised his up to block it .	1
seth pushed back , but i could see him shaking .	1
right when i thought he was winning , my mouth dropped open .	1
time seemed to slow as one of the other faery guys ran over to seth and the one he was locked with .	1
the faery raised one of the hilts of his sword and brought it down on seth .	1
it collided with his head and seth dropped his sword .	1
he crumpled to ground and did n't move .	1
seth !	1
i screamed .	1
he did n't move and one of the faery men reached down to grab him but i screeched , leave him alone !	1
and sent an arrow into the guy 's neck .	1
i heard jason yell in rage and they started to drop like stones .	1
emily raised her arms and the ground shook under a faery .	1
roots twisted upward and wrapped around one of the five faery men that were left .	1
the other four fell dead from my arrows and jason 's knives .	1
i ran out from behind the tree and stormed over to the squirming faery man .	1
or i should to call them faery jerks now .	1
i grabbed his coat and forced him to look at me .	1
he smirked and i could n't hold back the urge to slap him .	1
i slapped my hand across his face so hard it left a mark on his cheek .	1
start talking , i snarled .	1
who are you guys and what are you doing ?	1
the faery jerk smirked again .	1
we 're part of kojas ' personal guard .	1
we were sent to look for you half-lings .	1
well i want you to know something , i said and got closer to his face .	1
we will win this fight , mark my words .	1
kojas is going down , way down if you know what i mean .	1
well , he said , if you let me go i 'll give him your message .	1
i do n't think so , i whispered .	1
you can tell him when he joins you .	1
i rammed my knife into his stomach and pulled it out .	1
the faery 's eyes rolled upward and he went still .	1
i wiped my knife on my pants and sheathed it .	1
i ran over to jason , who was crouched over the unconscious seth .	1
jason looked up and i saw his face was full of concern .	1
can you help emily , she 's trying to release the trapped dragon , i whispered to him .	1
jason nodded .	1
will do jazell .	1
he stood up and walked over to emily .	1
i sat on the ground next to seth .	1
his eyes were closed and he looked dead .	1
his blue hair was ruffled up in all directions .	1
i was so sure that he might be dead that i placed a hand on his chest , feeling for a heartbeat .	1
i felt the steady thump under my fingers and i sighed in relief .	1
i removed my hand and looked over at emily .	1
they had freed the dragon and they both were petting its head .	1
it stretched its wings and they both had to duck to avoid being hit .	1
seth , i whispered , this is what i meant when i said things would get bad if we did n't tell them .	1
i looked back at my two friends , who were laughing .	1
i mean they are our friends , best buds , you get my drift .	1
i understand that you 're scared and worried but so am i. i 'm scared that if i 'm the only one who knows about this , i wo n't be enough to help you .	1
jazell , i understand now .	1
i 'm sorry i was such a jerk , i should have listened to you .	1
i turned back around to see seth 's eyes watching me .	1
he was clutching his head and groaning .	1
i gave him a hand and he grabbed it .	1
i helped him sit up and handed him his sword .	1
he laid it across his lap and looked at the ground .	1
i 'm glad that you 're okay and that you 've finally through your stubbornness , i said and gave him a small smile .	1
i just do n't know what to tell them .	1
well , tell them everything , i said .	1
start in the beginning and do n't hold anything back .	1
if you do , i 'll tell them the rest .	1
seth !	1
jason said and ran over .	1
you 're awake , man !	1
yes and i feel like crap , he said .	1
i think that if i try to stand up i 'll either pass out or throw up .	1
will you be okay flying ?	1
emily asked .	1
what ?	1
i asked .	1
flying ?	1
what do you mean 'flying ' , emily ?	1
our new dragon friend offered to fly us out of the woods region and towards more of the mountains .	1
i said yes , of course , because i do n't want to walk the whole way there , she explained and walked towards the dragon .	1
i guess ... seth said and stood up .	1
he paled and started to sway .	1
jason grabbed his shoulder to steady him .	1
thanks jason , he panted .	1
take it easy , seth .	1
we can wait a minute if you need to rest , but seth shook his head .	1
no let 's move now .	1
emily , tell us what to do .	1
alright , boss , she said sarcastically .	1
everyone come over .	1
we walked over to her and the dragon with seth leaning on jason .	1
the dragon was lying on the ground , watching us closely .	1
its long , leathery wings were tucked neatly on each of its sides .	1
it snorted as emily climbed onto its back .	1
i stared at her , starting to think she was a little crazy .	1
come on !	1
she said and patted the dragon 's back .	1
do you think that you 're too heavy ?	1
well , you are n't , so get on his back .	1
i walked over and climbed onto the dragon 's back .	1
jason half hauled seth on the dragon 's back , and seth almost fell on me .	1
he grunted a sorry and pushed himself up in sitting position .	1
jason hopped on last and gave emily two thumbs up .	1
alright , she called .	1
lets move !	1
the dragon stretched up and i bounced around for a second .	1
it opened its huge wings and launched itself into the air .	1
if youre thinking of trying dragon riding as a hobby , i wouldnt .	1
i fell backwards and landed on seth who snapped at me to get off .	1
i couldnt move because we were still going up and if you paid attention in science class , this is usually when you cant move .	1
its called gravity .	1
the dragon righted itself and i scrambled back into sitting position .	1
we were gliding high up in the eerie sky and the view was actually beautiful .	1
the trees looked like an endless sea of lush green and the sun peeked out from behind the clouds .	1
i felt the urge to hold my arms out like they do in those movies so i could feel the wind on my arms .	1
it was already making my hair flap all over the place .	1
i heard seth huff out and i turned .	1
he gave me a face and said , your hair keeps getting in my face .	1
i turned back around .	1
deal .	1
we turned in the air and i could see the mountains in the distance .	1
they were small but were growing fast as we neared them .	1
i could feel the dragons muscles pump underneath my legs .	1
small gusts of air rolled off the dragons wings that blew emilys hair in her face .	1
i smiled as she raked the pink strands out of her mouth .	1
we dipped down and i felt the stomach-in-your-chest feeling you usually get from rollercoasters .	1
i closed my eyes and tried to ignore it but i couldnt .	1
i hated this feeling just as much as i hated puking , and the chills that liked to run up my spine at random times .	1
then all of a sudden , the dragon stopped .	1
my eyes opened in horror as i saw the small trickle of blood fall from a hole in the right wing .	1
then we started to fall .	1
chapter 9 i screamed so loud that my ears felt like they were going to pop .	1
we plummeted to the ground , falling closer and closer oh man , i thought and closed my eyes .	1
dont look , dont look , dont look really !	1
seth yelled at the sky .	1
this brings new meaning to things cant get any worse !	1
i gripped furiously to the limp dragon .	1
i was falling to my death : so this is how it was going to end .	1
i never pictured it this way ; i thought i would die a little more heroically , not screaming like a little girl .	1
not now seth , emily screamed at him .	1
everyone think !	1
how can i think , i screeched back , when the ground is rushed towards me at full speed ?	1
i dont know jazell , just think if you want to live , she said quickly .	1
i let out another scream as my body tipped towards the edge of the dragon .	1
i felt someone wrap their arm around me and i gave a grunt as i was pulled upright .	1
seth held me , his arm stiff and somewhat uncomfortable .	1
i was frozen in fear , realizing that i hated falling .	1
this was worse than my fear of rollercoasters .	1
calm down , seth said to me .	1
youre not going to fall- what do you mean , seth ?	1
i said in a panicked voice .	1
were freaking falling right now !	1
emily looked at us and she tried to hide the fear in her face .	1
the dragon is going to pull its wings around us to protect us from falling but its going to make us fall faster .	1
make sure you hold on to something or get in the center .	1
seth pressed himself against me and we leaned closer to the dragons back .	1
jason tucked his arms under him and emily pressed next to him .	1
then , as if on cue , the dragon tucked its great wings over us , blocking out the sky and we began to really fall .	1
i screamed louder and sunk deeper into seth , trying to forget that we were falling at about 90 miles per hour without a parachute .	1
every second felt like an hour .	1
i squeezed my eyes in an effort to make it all go away .	1
make it stop , make it stop seth gave me a comforting squeeze but it didnt help .	1
i tried to think of something else , like penguins or llamas .	1
anything , i didnt care what i thought about , it could be underwear , as long as i wasnt thinking about what was actually happening to me right now .	1
llamas , i thought urgently .	1
llamas are furry and they spit at you when theyre mad .	1
theyre the joke of most middle school kids , theyre talli think .	1
you can see them at parks or zoos .	1
they tend to try to steal your dads hat at the zoo .	1
they can be black , brown , and white .	1
i dont think there are pink or purple or green llamas out there unless you dye them .	1
i saw a llama once when i was , six at the zoo , and it stole dads hat .	1
they had to send a park ranger to get it back because dad really liked that hat a bone-shaking bang scattered my thoughts .	1
pain shot through my side .	1
we rolled over and i fell on top of seth and then we both landed on jason .	1
emily landed on us and we all tumbled onto hard ground .	1
i didnt move .	1
instead i stared at the sky trying to understand how i wasnt dead .	1
i just was hurting all over and my back felt like i was run over by a car .	1
i sat up and my back cried out in protest .	1
i pushed myself into sitting position and crawled over to seth .	1
he had his arms behind his head and was staring at the sky .	1
he smiled at me when he saw me .	1
you okay ?	1
you freaked out before , he asked , his voice full of concern .	1
i nodded and answered shakily , you know that i hate falling .	1
you must have been scared too .	1
he hesitated .	1
yes , i was , but i think i was more concerned that you would wake the dead with your screams and they would attack us too .	1
i smacked him lightly on the arm and laid down next to him .	1
i stared at the sky .	1
so where are we ?	1
well , our winged friend managed to get us out of the woods and near the mountains .	1
you can see them over there .	1
he pointed off in the distance and i spotted the mountains towering above everything else .	1
thats good , at least all of this wasnt for nothing .	1
he sighed and closed his eyes .	1
yes , i did n't lose my hearing for nothing , because i had to listen to you scream .	1
are you ever going to drop that ?	1
i asked .	1
seth smirked .	1
nope , it 's going to haunt you for the rest of your life .	1
he made ghost sounds .	1
wait , i said suddenly , were n't you going to tell emily and jason about you-know-what ?	1
what ?	1
seth asked lazily and plucked at the grass .	1
i sat up and glared at him .	1
what do you mean , 'what ' ?	1
you said you were going to tell them !	1
i 'm going to tell them if you are n't .	1
i stood up , but seth was faster .	1
he grabbed my arm .	1
i stood there and stared at him .	1
please jazell , let me tell them myself , he begged .	1
i waited for him to let go , but his grip stayed firm and strong .	1
i stared at him .	1
fine but i 'm tired of waiting , seth .	1
i know , i promise i 'll tell them , he stood up , his grip still tight .	1
i just do n't think now is the right time .	1
after something like falling out of the sky , i do n't want to bring more bad news .	1
i sighed .	1
alright , i 'll leave this to you .	1
but i swear ...	1
i will , i promise you !	1
he interrupted me .	1
i believe you , seth , i whispered .	1
now are you good and clear ?	1
seth stared at me , looked down at my arm and let go .	1
he brushed his dirty hair away from his eyes and looked around .	1
i blinked and shook my head .	1
jazell !	1
seth !	1
i turned around and waved .	1
emily was running over with jason on her heels .	1
she slowed down and hugged me tight .	1
jason slapped seth on the back and bent over to catch his breath .	1
hey , where were you guys ?	1
i asked .	1
we were looking around to see if it was safe , emily said .	1
we thought you two were doing the same .	1
she put her hands on her hips .	1
i guess not .	1
are you going to get mad at me ?	1
i pouted .	1
she play punched me in the arm .	1
no , i 'll let it slide .	1
she winked at me .	1
i looked over at seth , trying to catch his eye but he avoided my gaze .	1
jason started talking to seth and the two whispered so we could n't hear .	1
emily rolled her eyes .	1
so did you find anything ?	1
i asked and traced the dirt with my foot .	1
emily shook her head .	1
nothing , we 're alone .	1
maybe we can try to get somewhere without bad guys jumping out at us .	1
we should move , before something does find us .	1
whatever knocked us out of the sky is n't going to be friendly if they find us again , i pointed out .	1
let 's move boys , we have a lot more walking to do .	1
jason groaned .	1
why ca n't they have cars in igneeria ?	1
or maybe a motorcycle , i 'm even fine with a golf cart .	1
because , i said and walked past him , not looking back , igneerians are n't lazy jason 's .	1
i heard him huff and emily ran up beside me .	1
good thinking , she said .	1
the girls should take control .	1
i shrugged .	1
i guess if that 's what you want to do .	1
thankfully , there were no trees anywhere except one .	1
the ground was mostly dirt and rock , easier to walk on .	1
the mountains loomed ahead of us and something tingled down my spine .	1
something was going to happen in those mountains , i just knew .	1
the sky was clearer here and also more windy .	1
the wind tugged at my hair and clothes as i walked .	1
i had to keep squinting to see through my hair .	1
i felt a tap on my shoulder and i looked over .	1
emily held her hand out .	1
here jazell , use this to keep your hair out of your face , she opened her hand and dropped something in my palm .	1
i held it up .	1
it was a thin , vine that was about a foot long .	1
it felt like a ribbon to me and i shrugged .	1
i do n't usually wear ribbons and bows ; that was emily 's style .	1
i pulled my hair back and tied the vine .	1
it kept my hair out of my face and acted like a rubber band .	1
thanks emily , i said .	1
she finished tying her hair back .	1
no problem .	1
we should look for somewhere to stay for the night .	1
i looked around , but everywhere was bare ground , hill after hill .	1
i do n't see any caves .	1
we 'll just have to sleep in the open , she stated and pointed to a huge tree .	1
we 'll sleep under that tree .	1
okay , i said , a little disappointed .	1
seth , jason , we 're going to sleep over here .	1
jason sighed in relief and we all gathered around the bottom of the tree .	1
i stretched and leaned against the trunk of the tree , happy for the silence .	1
but , of course , that never lasts around here .	1
hey , did n't we stop the water war ?	1
emily asked .	1
we never got to finish it and see who would win .	1
jason laughed .	1
yes , we did , that 's right !	1
it does n't matter though ; seth and i would have won anyway .	1
no , she said , staring him down .	1
we would win because we 're awesome .	1
no we would win because we 're awesome !	1
jason argued .	1
oh boy , what did the two start ?	1
i asked seth .	1
this is going to go on and on and on and on ...	1
i get it , he interrupted me .	1
this is never going to end .	1
we 'll be up all night .	1
unless you interrupt them and tell them about your secret , i said .	1
seth looked down .	1
you want them to kill me ?	1
maybe i 'll tell them in the morning when they are n't so crabby .	1
you better , i snapped and stared at emily and jason .	1
they were still bickering .	1
i felt something on my hand and i looked down .	1
seth had wound his fingers in mine .	1
his touch was gentle and cool , kind of reassuring .	1
my mind blanked .	1
i was holding hands with seth .	1
i never thought that would happen .	1
seth smiled sheepishly .	1
jazell , you should just relax .	1
let them bicker all they want ; we do n't have to be a part of it .	1
get some sleep .	1
my mind was still slow , trying to process why he was holding my hand .	1
i blinked and nodded .	1
alright but if it starts getting crazy , wake me up .	1
wake you up ?	1
he asked and laughed .	1
i 'm sleeping too .	1
if it gets crazy , they 'll wake us up .	1
okay , i said and yawned .	1
i leaned my head against the tree and closed my eyes .	1
the world seemed to fade around me , along with the bickering and seth 's hand , as i fell asleep .	1
i opened my eyes to see that i was in a cave .	1
i peered at the entrance of the cave to see that outside it was dark .	1
i walked toward the entrance when something stopped me .	1
do n't go into the shadows , jazell , a familiar voice said .	1
it was the voice from my last dream .	1
i whirled around in a circle , looking for the source of the voice .	1
there was nothing here .	1
who are you ?	1
i asked , trying to calm down .	1
can i trust you ?	1
trust me like your shadow , the voice said again .	1
but you said to beware of shadows , i said .	1
so does that mean i ca n't trust you ?	1
you know your shadow , there is a difference , the voice said again .	1
i shook my head .	1
this is confusing , why do n't you understand that ?	1
there was a pause .	1
i do understand ; i hated it too .	1
all the annoying riddles but that 's the way it 's supposed to be .	1
then the voice said stronger , look behind you .	1
i turned back around to see the inside of the cave .	1
a girl was walking towards me , the same one i saw last time .	1
she didnt like it because i was staring at her , but i could n't help it .	1
she stopped in front of me .	1
you 're not supposed to see me yet , she said and sighed .	1
oh well , i never was one to follow the rules .	1
who are you ?	1
she shook her head .	1
i ca n't tell you yet .	1
that 's one rule i 'm not going to break .	1
i opened my mouth but she shook her head .	1
do n't ask what my name is or why i 'm talking to you , because i ca n't answer either of those questions .	1
what can you tell me then ?	1
i can tell you that i 'm not an enemy , she said .	1
i can also tell you to be careful about kojas ; he 's tricky and will use your emotions against you .	1
he 'll find a way to get you to come to him instead of him coming to you .	1
she huffed , coward .	1
how do you know ?	1
she smiled sadly .	1
let 's just say i know what i 'm talking about .	1
be careful and keep your friends close .	1
the four of you were chosen because of your unbreakable bond , but even that can be broken .	1
you are strongest when you are together , so dont let yourselves be separated .	1
would n't it be called 'an breakable bond ' , then ?	1
i asked her .	1
she laughed but then grew serious .	1
be very careful .	1
we all know that we picked the right four , but it would be a shame if something happened to all of you before you could complete your goal .	1
that got my attention .	1
you know how we became half-lings ?	1
you know who attacked us that day ?	1
i 've said too much already , she said and backed up .	1
i must go .	1
wait !	1
i called .	1
wait ; tell me what 's going on !	1
tell me what we 're supposed to do !	1
but she was already gone .	1
*** i opened my eyes and the cold of the morning bit at my cheeks .	1
seth was fast asleep next to me , his blue hair covering half his face .	1
emily was curled up a few feet away from me .	1
jason turned in his sleep , mumbling something unintelligent .	1
i needed to talk to someone , but everyone was sleeping .	1
i pushed seth over and his eyes flew open .	1
his hand went to his sword but he saw me and he relaxed .	1
what was the point of pushing me over , jazell ?	1
well , it seemed better than punching you in the side .	1
were you dreaming ?	1
i asked .	1
he shook his head .	1
just a bunch of nonsense i do n't even remember .	1
why , did you get another vision ?	1
yes , i said .	1
it was with the same voice that was in my last dream .	1
only this time , i talked to the ghost girl .	1
you did ?	1
what did she say ?	1
she hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day , i said .	1
she also said that kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him .	1
something dark crossed seth 's face .	1
she also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond , but she said , not to test it , i continued .	1
she also told me not to go into the shadows .	1
seth stretched .	1
so the usual confusion ?	1
i got more this time , seth .	1
anyway , do you have any information to offer here ?	1
i asked with an edge to my voice .	1
seth put his arms in surrender .	1
hey , do n't start yelling at me .	1
we were getting a long pretty well last night , let 's keep it that way .	1
i felt my face flush when i remembered last night .	1
yes , you 're right .	1
i was eager to change the subject so i said , are you going to tell them when they wake up ?	1
yes i will , jazell .	1
i promised .	1
i sighed in relief .	1
good ...	1
i heard a loud yawn and emily stretched her arms in the air .	1
she stood up and walked the couple of feet over to me and stopped .	1
i pushed myself up and leaned against the tree .	1
emily gave me a light smile .	1
good morning !	1
she said and twirled around .	1
hello bare ground that has no forest !	1
you seem to be in a good mood today , i mused and watched her twirl .	1
she stopped and her face crinkled up in thought .	1
i think it 's because i did n't wake up to be in a never-ending forest .	1
plus , last night jason got so sick of arguing with me he just gave up .	1
i think i won .	1
great , i said half-heartedly .	1
that 's only because i was too tired to keep arguing with you , jason said and he sat down next to seth .	1
if it was morning , it would have been different .	1
emily sighed and shook her finger .	1
excuses .	1
listen guys , seth said , i have something to tell you .	1
he looked at me and i nodded .	1
emily twirled her hair .	1
hm ?	1
what is it seth ?	1
i 've been hiding this from you for a long time , seth began .	1
only jazell knew what it was because she found out that i was hiding something , and demanded to know what it was .	1
so i told her , and ever since i did she 's been bugging me to tell you too .	1
but i did n't want to , i was afraid that i would get you worried about nothing .	1
so far it has n't turned out to be nothing .	1
the incident with the faery guard showed that clearly .	1
i walked over to him and sat at his other side .	1
i gave him a smile .	1
he smiled back and continued .	1
the faery could have easily stabbed me through the heart but he did n't because he wanted me alive ; to give to kojas .	1
emily gasped and covered her face .	1
why , what would he want with you ?	1
seth closed his eyes .	1
he 's saying that i 'm going to be his key to success , in taking over igneeria and earth .	1
he wants to use me , i do n't know how yet .	1
they 're going to do whatever they can to bring me to him ; i 'm going to have to be extra careful .	1
i do n't know- seth , jason interrupted him .	1
seth looked up at his best friend .	1
seth , jason repeated , you are n't alone .	1
kojas is n't going to get a chance to use you because he 's going to have to get through me first .	1
and me , emily added .	1
do n't count me out .	1
i stood up and faced seth with emily and jason .	1
and he 's going to have to get through me too .	1
seth smiled and stood up .	1
he sighed in relief .	1
well , that 's a load off .	1
i do n't know whether i should be mad at you for not telling us or be happy that we 're all on the same page , emily said thoughtfully .	1
but you better not keep anything else from us or kojas wo n't be your problem .	1
she winked at him and set off with jason on her heels .	1
i think they were going to start arguing about the water war .	1
great job seth !	1
i said and hugged him .	1
his eyes seemed to widen in surprise but he did n't tell me to get off .	1
i pulled away , blushed , and started to follow emily 's tracks .	1
seth followed behind me and there seemed to be a new spring to his step .	1
i could n't even keep the smile off my face .	1
everything seemed a lot better to me .	1
at the top of the hill , emily and jason were waiting for us .	1
a shadow formed behind them and i screamed for them to turn around .	1
what the heck ?	1
seth shouted and pointed .	1
oh snap .	1
chapter 10 emily and jason dashed back to our sides as the shadow became a body .	1
it was bigger than the dragon we had rode .	1
it had the body of a huge cockroach but its tail was a giant stinger .	1
large , bat wings were holding it up in the air .	1
what is it ?	1
i asked .	1
i turned to emily and said , emily , you know anything about this creature ?	1
she looked pale .	1
it 's saying , 'kill half-lings , kill and eat . '	1
well , you better tell it that it 's going to have to starve this time because it 's not going to be eating anything , seth said confidently and held his sword out .	1
she shook her head .	1
there is no way that i 'm going to say that .	1
jazell , can you see its weakness ?	1
seth called to me .	1
i squinted at the creature , and saw a dark circle under its belly .	1
it 's under its belly , but you have to get by the stinger first .	1
that might cause us a problem .	1
no problem , seth replied and swung his sword in an ark .	1
well just cut off the stinger .	1
seth its not that simple i said but he ignored me .	1
ug , the nerve of that boy .	1
jason , try to hit its face , he instructed .	1
emily , knock it off balance .	1
can i skip while i do it ?	1
emily asked .	1
he gritted his teeth .	1
fine .	1
he turned to me .	1
jazell , youll aim for the belly while we hold it off .	1
if you cant get an arrow in before i can cut off the stinger , then ill have to do it myself .	1
fine boss dude , i said with a snort .	1
seth ducked and charged the creature , his sword held out behind him .	1
jason flicked some knives into his wrist and flung them at the creature .	1
some hit their mark , which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain , others fell into the dirt .	1
emily danced close to it , spinning fire from her fingertips .	1
the creature raised a leg and swatted at her but she just twirled away .	1
the stinger narrowly missed seth , and i saw him stumble back in surprise .	1
he swung his sword at the stinger .	1
it sliced through and the creature screeched so loud i was afraid everyone would hear it .	1
the stinger fell on the ground and dark blood oozed from the cut .	1
now jazell !	1
seth yelled to me .	1
i notched an arrow and took aim at the thrashing belly .	1
i pulled the string back and released it .	1
the arrow whizzed through the air and sunk into the creatures belly .	1
it shook and fell to the ground .	1
seth ran from underneath it right before it crushed him .	1
he turned around and studied it .	1
then there was a horrible sound , like ripping metal .	1
the belly of the creature seemed to open up and winds picked up .	1
seth threw down his sword as the wind sucked at him .	1
he tried to keep himself from being pulled in .	1
i ran up to him with emily and jason right behind me .	1
the winds were so powerful i started to slide toward the body , before i was even close enough .	1
seths knuckles were white in the effort to hold himself down .	1
get back , he ordered .	1
get back or well all- he didnt get to finish his sentence because his sword came loose and we all were sucked into the black void of the creature .	1
*** i hit the ground so hard my breath was knocked out .	1
i laid there , sucking in painful breaths and staring at the sky .	1
there was something different about it , even though it was gloomy .	1
there was more than gloom and sadness in the air this time , it was something cold , like death .	1
i shivered because the ground was so cold and hard that it chilled me to the bone .	1
seths head blocked out my vision .	1
hey , you alright ?	1
i sat up and seth helped me up .	1
i rubbed my sore back and looked around , taking in the dead looking trees and shadows .	1
where are we ?	1
i dont know , jazell .	1
the creature must have been a setup to bring us here , he replied .	1
i think i know who did it .	1
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure that out , seth , i pointed out .	1
i looked around .	1
where are the others ?	1
seth went pale .	1
i dont know jazell , they arent here .	1
theyre just gone .	1
my stomach twisted into a knot .	1
we had always been a group of four and now it was just the two of us .	1
the ghost girls words came back to me .	1
the four of you were chosen because of your unbreakable bond , but even that can be broken .	1
you are strongest when you are together , but dont let yourselves be separated .	1
kojas had separated us because he already knew that .	1
the girl had warned us for a reason .	1
she had known that kojas was going to try to split us up into groups so that we would be weak .	1
i watched seth pace back and forth , nervously running his fingers through his hair and drumming the hilt of his sword .	1
i can also tell you to be careful about kojas ; he 's tricky and will use your emotions against you .	1
he 'll find a way to get you to come to him instead of him coming to you .	1
the girl had told us more than we had thought .	1
maybe kojas thought we would both imagine that he did something to the other two so that we would come running to him .	1
i had a feeling that emily and jason were okay and just as confused as us .	1
that also meant that kojas knew as much , and maybe more than us .	1
*** emily pushed herself into sitting position , ignoring the sharp pains in her elbows and knees .	1
jason was leaning against a tree nearby , tossing a knife from hand to hand .	1
she saw a deep , red scratch on his left cheek and the way he winced every time he moved his right arm , she could tell she must have injured it .	1
do you know where the others are ?	1
she asked him .	1
he shook his head .	1
no , theyre just gone .	1
were separated ?	1
she said nervously .	1
yes , he replied .	1
what do we do ?	1
why are you asking me ?	1
she demanded .	1
youre the one who comes up with plans .	1
emily paced back and forth , trying to think .	1
where were seth and jazell ?	1
were they okay ?	1
more importantly , where were they ?	1
i dont know , she said finally .	1
i just dont know .	1
oh no , jason said nervously .	1
when emily doesnt know , the world ends .	1
do you wish now that you were at home , curled up with a book ?	1
yes .	1
*** seth , i said , calm down and think .	1
we cant stay here forever , and pace.seth didnt stop and he started mumbling under his breath .	1
i walked up and pushed him around .	1
seth , you have to think .	1
kojas did this on purpose , hes trying to weaken us by splitting us up .	1
he wants us to go running to him .	1
i know what hes trying to do , its driving me crazy .	1
the nerve of this guy .	1
faery , i corrected him .	1
hes not a guy , hes some demon faery .	1
calling him guy makes it sound like hes just a normal human .	1
does it matter right now ?	1
he asked , through clenched teeth .	1
i looked away .	1
i guess not .	1
we should move , he said .	1
i want to find out where we are and where the others are .	1
were going to find them and i swear by the bible , if kojas hurt them , im going to kill him myself .	1
seth !	1
he shrugged .	1
its too late now jazell , i just swore by the bible .	1
kojas means business and if he wants this to be a war , ill give him a war .	1
then he stormed into the trees and disappeared .	1
wait , seth !	1
i yelled and ran into the trees .	1
i scanned the trees .	1
seth !	1
seth where the- a hand clamped down on my mouth and i spun around , knife in hand .	1
seth dropped his hand and pushed past me .	1
stop yelling my name , jazell , or youll tell the whole world that im here .	1
my arm dropped and i slid the knife back in its sheath .	1
i followed seth through the trees .	1
this time there were less of them and the only ones that around us looked half dead .	1
the bark was peeling off and i could see the tree branches leaning towards the ground .	1
the air was cold and heavy , like a mound of snow on your shoulders .	1
the trees parted to show a cliff .	1
we walked up to the edge and the wind whipped at my face .	1
a feeling of dj vu came upon me .	1
i knew where we were because i had been here before .	1
seth , i was here in my dream , the one with kojas and the dwarf , i said .	1
his eyes widened and he looked down at the ground below , obviously trying to imagine what it had looked like .	1
i had seen it and i was seriously scarred for my life .	1
you sure ?	1
he asked .	1
you know that this means that kojas was here , so he cant be too far away .	1
dont get your hopes up .	1
i saw him once and i have no intention of being near him anytime soon .	1
he sat on the edge , the wind tossing around his hair .	1
it was going to be seriously wind-blown later .	1
i sat down next to him and i was trying to forget the dwarfs mangled body .	1
i shook and hugged myself .	1
are you cold ?	1
he asked , his voice full of concern .	1
i just shrugged and squeezed my eyes shut .	1
i saw kojas glowing eyes and sword , the dwarf , his armies , the ghost girl , the dark woods and her haunting voice .	1
it all crashed down on me , the weight of the whole situation .	1
we were being hunted , i could die .	1
oh boy , this is what happen when i think things out .	1
you are cold , he stated .	1
dont deny it ; youre shaking like a leaf .	1
wait i dont like that analogy , youre shaking like a mole rat .	1
do mole rats shake ?	1
i asked .	1
he rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around my shoulder .	1
we sat there in silence and i leaned on his shoulder .	1
we both stopped shivering as we stared at the sky .	1
seth , im scared , i whispered .	1
what happens if something goes wrong ?	1
nothing will go wrong , he said fiercely .	1
i wont let it happen .	1
i closed my eyes .	1
i keep seeing what happened that night .	1
itll go away , he said .	1
there was a long silence .	1
this is too awkward and i dont like the silence .	1
its not normal for us .	1
i laughed .	1
someone make a joke quick !	1
okay , he said .	1
this feels like those weird movies where the boy puts his arm around the girl and then something comes out of nowhere and eats them both .	1
i laughed so hard i gagged .	1
ive never seen that kind of movie .	1
i did and it was lame .	1
i smiled and twirled a leaf in one of my hands .	1
maybe everything was going to be okay after all .	1
*** hurry up jason , youre so slow !	1
emily yelled at him .	1
jason walked the rest of the way up the hill and bent over to catch his breath .	1
we 've been walking all day and you 're not tired ?	1
nope , i 've got dancer muscles .	1
jason sat on the ground .	1
well , i have artist muscles and those are in my hands .	1
emily rolled her eyes .	1
then walk on your hands .	1
no way !	1
he said .	1
fine , then do n't complain .	1
she climbed into a small tree that was near the cliff she had spotted .	1
she leaned back and let out a sigh of relief .	1
her legs were killing her but she was n't going to tell jason that .	1
he got up and sat at the base of the tree .	1
you had to take the good tree ?	1
she motioned around .	1
there are plenty of trees to pick from jason .	1
so pick one .	1
he mumbled something and closed his eyes .	1
emily shook her head .	1
he was too stubborn sometimes .	1
emily stared at the sky and then she knew what he had said .	1
she looked down to say something but jason was fast asleep .	1
he had said he was n't going to leave her alone .	1
*** jazell , maybe we should try to go down there , seth said and nodded to the ground below .	1
i shrugged .	1
why ?	1
it might lead up somewhere .	1
plus , if jason and emily see it too , they might go down .	1
it 'll be easier to find each other .	1
okay , i said and stood up .	1
i brushed the dirt off my pants and followed seth , who was walking off to the side .	1
he went down to the left of the ledge and followed a steep path .	1
i walked behind him and had to dig my heels in to avoid from slipping down .	1
the path ended and seth had to jump down to reach the bottom .	1
he landed gracefully but almost tripped .	1
i walked up to the edge of the path and jumped off .	1
i flung my arms out to steady myself .	1
seth grinned at my clumsiness and waited for me to walk up to him .	1
i wacked his head with the back of my hand , making his hair stick up .	1
he smoothed it down and we walked across the flat ground .	1
the ground had spots of grass sticking out of sand and rock .	1
luckily , there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt .	1
i think i passed the spot where the kojas had stood in my dream .	1
i threw the thoughts out of my head and tried to think of something else .	1
like , where this flat plain of flatness ended .	1
where are we going , anyway ?	1
i asked and stared at the sky .	1
it was going to get dark soon .	1
he looked up at me through his hair .	1
i could see the curved end of his lip , which met he was smiling .	1
do we ever know , jazell ?	1
good point .	1
*** emily could n't sleep .	1
she kept closing her eyes but it did n't seem like a time to sleep .	1
she wanted to do something , just to occupy her busy mind .	1
she watched a strange creature fly over to her tree and hook itself on a branch near her .	1
it looked like a butterfly with only one set of wings , which were transparent and seemed to glow .	1
it had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle .	1
emily watched it and its beauty ; she did n't think that something this pretty could be found in a place so dark and full of death .	1
hello , it said .	1
emily propped herself up on her elbow .	1
hi , what are you ?	1
an augothas .	1
it replied and fluttered its wings .	1
are you a half-ling ?	1
yes , how did you know ?	1
is it that obvious ?	1
the augothas seemed to cock its head .	1
well you ca n't be a faery because you do n't have the ears and you ca n't be a pixie because they 're always giggling around .	1
how can you understand me ?	1
emily shrugged .	1
i do n't know , it 's this new power i have .	1
my friend has one too .	1
that sounds like the other one .	1
what do you mean ?	1
she asked .	1
the augothas uncurled its tail and took off in the air .	1
i must go , friend .	1
good luck .	1
it took off into the sky and emily could n't see it anymore .	1
she sighed and leaned back .	1
this was getting too complicated .	1
who had the augothas meant ?	1
*** the sky had turned gray and the sun , which was still hiding behind the clouds , seemed to drop .	1
i was still walking and walking and walking and walking and walking ... you get my point .	1
i was so sick of walking i could n't explain it in words .	1
maybe in a song , here i go : lalalala !	1
so sick of walking !	1
lalalala !	1
my legs are gon na come off !	1
lalalala !	1
i want a golf cart !	1
that 's how much i was sick of walking ; i was making a freaking song up in my head .	1
i never do stuff like that , never .	1
but i guess my mind was tired of seeing the same thing over and over again .	1
i wish it would get interesting .	1
oh , it was going to get really interesting .	1
the ground rumbled and we both stopped dead .	1
i looked at the earth and cracks appeared .	1
then dirt started to cave in .	1
i screeched as the ground gave way under me .	1
can my life get any worse ?	1
*** emily , jason said , i heard something .	1
emily 's head jerked up and then she remembered that jason was below her and she looked down .	1
jason was staring at the plains below the edge .	1
emily climbed down the tree and ran over to him .	1
she could see a puff of dirt that was tossed up in the distance .	1
emily squinted her eyes .	1
what is it ?	1
i do n't know , he said .	1
should we head out there ?	1
i think we should , she replied .	1
we have nowhere else to go .	1
chapter 11 jazell !	1
seth yelled , but his voice was muffled by the dirt flying everywhere .	1
i grabbed at something , anything , but there was no hold .	1
seth , where are you ?	1
i thought that he said something but , i could n't hear him .	1
all i could hear was the blood pounding in my ear and my racing heartbeat .	1
dirt fell into my mouth and i coughed , trying to get rid of it .	1
my vision was closing , getting dark .	1
i 'm tired ...	1
i closed my eyes as i fell into darkness .	1
*** seth opened his eyes and curled up , retching .	1
he took in deep , shaky breaths and laid back , staring up .	1
he narrowed his eyes and saw a small spot of light .	1
what the heck ?	1
he was underground , in a cave .	1
he groaned and sat up , his back throbbing .	1
his head was pounding so hard he had to close his eyes to keep from passing out .	1
he felt worse than he did when the stupid faery smashed his sword into his head .	1
he looked around the dimly lit cavern and spotted jazell , sprawled out on the floor .	1
he crawled over to her .	1
*** i couched and gagged , turning over .	1
dirt fell to the ground from my dry mouth .	1
i looked over to see seth fall back on the ground , breathing heavily .	1
i looked around the room and up at the sky , but i could n't really see it .	1
seth , where are we ?	1
i asked , my voice hoarse .	1
he sat up .	1
i think we 're in some underground cave .	1
when the ground collapsed , it must have carried us here .	1
that stinks , i said .	1
are we stuck here ?	1
not unless you know a way to grow wings with nothing but dirt .	1
i stood up and tried to rake the dirt out of my hair .	1
we 're stuck here .	1
seth sighed in frustration and brushed his blue hair .	1
he fluffed it up but the dirt was still stuck in globs .	1
i rolled my eyes at his attempts .	1
i turned around to see an entrance .	1
i walked over and bent down .	1
there seemed to be some kind of sign or symbol .	1
it was two circles with a sword through the center of both .	1
seth , look !	1
i said and pointed to it .	1
he came over and bent down , tracing the sign with his finger .	1
i waited and finally said , well , do you know what it is ?	1
seth dropped his finger .	1
it means , 'slayer of worlds ' .	1
does that ring a bell ?	1
how do you know that ?	1
i asked .	1
he shrugged .	1
i do n't know how , i just do .	1
maybe that 's my power .	1
well , i want to go this way , i said and pointed to the entrance .	1
if something like that is on the entrance , i want to know where this goes .	1
i agree but are n't we supposed to be trying to find emily and jason ?	1
i have an idea , i said and pulled my bow off my back .	1
i removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground .	1
i walked over to seth and pulled his sword out of its sheath .	1
he grabbed for it but i already had it in my hands .	1
i put the tip against the arrow and carved the same sign as the one on the wall .	1
then i tossed seth 's sword back at him , which he caught without a problem , and picked up my bow .	1
i notched the carved arrow and released it .	1
it whizzed up and out of sight .	1
there , now they 'll know how to find us .	1
seth whistled .	1
that 's a good idea .	1
he gripped his sword and walked through the tunnel .	1
follow me .	1
i followed his steps as we .	1
when you tell someone to follow you , it usually means that you know where you 're going .	1
not this time , he said over his shoulder .	1
the tunnel ended and opened up to the sky .	1
for a second i thought we were back on the plain , but we were n't .	1
the sky was blood red and a crescent moon was rising up .	1
from the feeling of the air i knew we were n't underground anymore but i did n't know where we were .	1
skeleton trees were scattered to the sides .	1
there were long hills ahead , the grass a light gray .	1
this place looks like its from a book about hell , seth said .	1
where are we now ?	1
i asked .	1
he shook his head .	1
do we ever know where we are ?	1
i shook my head and he sighed .	1
exactly , we never do .	1
you really got to stop asking that question .	1
he started to hike the hill .	1
were trying to find out .	1
i walked up behind him , my leg muscles cramping .	1
when we got to the top , i fell on my knees and breathed heavily .	1
seth looked over his shoulder , his eyes twinkling in amusement .	1
am i too fast for you , jazell ?	1
no way , i huffed .	1
i just need to catch my breath .	1
i stood up and looked around .	1
the hill was pretty high and i could see better .	1
the land was hill after hill , tree after tree .	1
it didnt seem to end .	1
hey , im king of the hill , seth joked and reached for the sky .	1
i walked over and pushed him gently .	1
he fell backward on his butt and i laughed .	1
more like goof of the hill .	1
he stuck his tongue out .	1
youre just jealous .	1
of what ?	1
i asked .	1
what do you have that would make me jealous .	1
uh he stumbled .	1
i dont know , thats what you usually say in this type of situation .	1
i laughed .	1
then what happens ?	1
i dont know .	1
seth whipped out his leg and tripped me .	1
i landed with an oof , and got dead grass all over me .	1
he chuckled as i gave him a deadly glare .	1
oh !	1
he said .	1
youre jealous because im not covered in grass .	1
not yet , i said , my voice dripping with sarcasm .	1
i lunged at him and he rolled to the side .	1
i kicked dirt at his face and he spit it out .	1
i kicked at his legs but he moved , and i kicked his arm instead .	1
the whole time we were laughing like two crazy six year olds .	1
who knew that you could have fun in a place like this ?	1
life is full of happy surprises .	1
*** emily was seriously freaking out .	1
jason and her had run the whole length of the plain and found a giant hole in the ground on the way .	1
yes , a giant hole .	1
it sounded crazy to emily but her eyes didnt lie .	1
and what made it worse was jason found one of jazells arrows sticking out of the ground .	1
but there was no jazell .	1
an arrow without its shooter was never a good sign .	1
emily twirled the arrow in her fingers while jason paced back and forth .	1
emily had offered to be the one who paced but jason had waved away her offer and started pacing .	1
so all emily could do was sit there and twirl the arrow in fear because right now it wasnt looking good for jazell and seth .	1
what i dont get , jason said , is how the arrow managed to stay in perfect shape when the ground collapsed .	1
the arrow should be broken and not sticking out of the ground a few feet away .	1
maybe she shot it after , emily suggested , because that meant that she was alive .	1
jason rubbed his eyes .	1
i guess thats a possibility .	1
jazell and seth were always too stubborn to die anyway .	1
he stopped pacing .	1
but why would she shoot it up here ?	1
maybe she wanted to show us that she was alive , emily said .	1
a sign , jason muttered and snapped his fingers .	1
thats it !	1
jazell likes to leave clues , check the arrow .	1
emily turned the arrow and saw a sloppy line drawn through two squiggly circles .	1
she squinted closer and saw that jazell had tried to make the line some sort of sword but epically failed .	1
emily showed jason and he nodded .	1
thats what i thought .	1
now we have to figure out what it means .	1
emily walked up to the edge of the hole and looked down .	1
i have a feeling that we have to go down there .	1
jason sighed .	1
i guess were jumping down .	1
why would we do that ?	1
because , he said and sat on the side , we dont have a rope .	1
then he jumped .	1
*** life is good when you dont have to worry about anything and everything is calm and peaceful .	1
well thats not my life .	1
my life isnt peaceful by any standards .	1
it involves lots of smart remarks and bad decisions involving life or death .	1
it also involves a bad choice of a place where you roll around pretending like your life could be normal for a second .	1
yeah seth sat up quickly and looked around .	1
he must have heard it too .	1
the ground rumbled in the distance and i didnt know if it was an earthquake or a stampede of elephants .	1
whats going on ?	1
i asked .	1
seth crawled back to the edge and i joined him .	1
we peered over and i spotted a bunch of monsters stomping their way across the hills .	1
seriously , do these guys know how to walk ?	1
great , seth hissed under his breath .	1
company for us .	1
whoo i mumbled .	1
he rolled his eyes and shifted his gaze back to the monsters .	1
where are they going ?	1
uh , we follow them , i said .	1
i think .	1
yup , we just follow a bunch of monsters that would like to smash us to pulp and serve us for dinner , seth said and started to slide down the side of the hill .	1
brilliant idea .	1
i followed him down , feeling the grass and dirt scrape the bottom of my leg .	1
my pants started to scrunch up causing this slide to be very annoying .	1
i decided to ignore it because i had my bow in my hands and had more important things to worry about .	1
we crouched behind a rock and watched the group walk off .	1
seth started to stand up and signaled me to wait for him .	1
he jumped over and ran out into the open .	1
he leaned forward and narrowed his eyes , probably trying to see the disappearing bunch .	1
he held his hand out , signaling me to wait .	1
then he beckoned me and i stood up .	1
then someone tapped me on the shoulder .	1
i bit back a scream and whipped out my knife .	1
but i dropped it in surprise as i spotted emily standing over me , rocking back and forth on her heels .	1
i squealed and hugged her tight .	1
jason was limping over with a grim expression on his face .	1
what i dont get a hug too ?	1
he asked .	1
i jumped down a deep hole for you .	1
uh i said , feeling awkward .	1
seth walked over and patted jason on his back .	1
tell you what , when we defeat kojas , ill give you a hug .	1
uh , fine dude , jason said and whispered in seths ear .	1
seths eyes widened and he smacked jason on the head .	1
dude , youre crazy , he said as jason rubbed and smoothed his hair back down .	1
i shook my head and said , anyway , emily how come you two didnt destroy each other ?	1
hey youre right , she replied and her brow furrowed .	1
i really dont know .	1
jazell , we better move or well lose them , seth reminded me and started to walk up the hill .	1
emily raised an eyebrow .	1
loose who ?	1
well explain later !	1
i said and ran after seth .	1
right now we have to move !	1
we dashed up the hill in the direction the monsters were going .	1
when we reached the top , seth stopped and stared down .	1
emily and jason looked confused but joined us .	1
we looked down at the ground and i gasped as i saw all the monsters gather around in a semi-circle , waiting .	1
what are they waiting for ?	1
emily asked in a hushed voice .	1
seth squinted down .	1
i dont want to know .	1
do you think it could ?	1
i asked .	1
lets hope not , seth interrupted me .	1
oh course ; being ourselves , we dont have any luck at all .	1
the sky darkened even more , not that i thought that was possible .	1
the mist swirled and a cold chill that ran shivers down my spine ascended on us .	1
and out of the mist stepped a dark figure .	1
kojas .	1
again .	1
this time for real .	1
not in a dream/vision .	1
my heart stopped and my blood froze .	1
kojas red eyes gleamed in the darkness and his cloak snapped at the wind .	1
he looked up and his red eyes stared at me .	1
me of all people in this horrible world .	1
he smiled in triumph .	1
seth stared stone faced at kojas as he slowly walked towards us .	1
with every step , seths hand inched closer to his sword .	1
emily cracked her knuckles quietly and held them stiff at her sides .	1
her face was determined , but i saw her eyes flicker .	1
jason flicked out his knives and held them so tightly that his knuckles were white .	1
if he gripped any harder , i was afraid he would snap his fingers off .	1
and , me ?	1
i pulled an arrow out faster than you could say oh-my-god-theres-a-hideous-monster-coming-to-whip-our-butts .	1
and then i launched it .	1
the arrow shot at kojas , speeding through the air .	1
but what did kojas do ?	1
he whipped out his sword and slashed the arrow in half right before it hit him .	1
the pieces fell on the ground .	1
holy tamale .	1
i stared at the cracked pieces of my arrow and my flare of determination went out with a poof .	1
great , now what do i do ?	1
that was a fail , i scolded myself .	1
a fail !	1
nice try , seth whispered and i think he really meant it .	1
or maybe he was teasing me .	1
its hard to tell in these situations .	1
seth brandished his sword .	1
my turn .	1
really , warrior ?	1
kojas said and laughed .	1
his laugh was like a bunch of spiders running down my back .	1
you think your sword will do any more than the pathetic archer girls arrow ?	1
hey , i shouted , im not a pathetic archer girl !	1
oh course , the two ignored me .	1
i swear the air sizzled with the tension between kojas and seth .	1
seth stood ridged and i was pretty sure that it was taking all of his will power not to jump at kojas , sword flying .	1
i believe it will , seth said through gritted teeth .	1
kojas laughed again but i dont think any of us saw what was so funny .	1
emily leaned towards me .	1
i think you were right , when you said that i wouldnt want to meet kojas .	1
uh-huh , i said but didnt really pay attention .	1
i would like to see you try with that sword of yours , kojas said and smiled wickedly at seth .	1
i knew he was baiting him .	1
seth narrowed his eyes .	1
you cant trick me into fighting you , kojas .	1
yeah , were not stupid , i said and stepped next to seth with my hands on my hips .	1
i mean , if youre so smart , than why is your name so stupid .	1
i giggled .	1
kojas sounds like toe jazz , whatever that is .	1
i heard emily laugh and jason say , burn !	1
kojas eyes flamed but he formed a tight smile .	1
let me inform you , jazell , that you are outnumbered five to one ?	1
man , this guy is good .	1
um , well weare cooler than you , i stumbled .	1
really jazell ?	1
emily hissed from behind me .	1
i turned my head to her .	1
well , you come up with something to top that and well see how well you do .	1
nah , im good , she said quickly .	1
kojas laughed again .	1
seriously , was this faery guy crazy or something ?	1
you are mistaken , he said .	1
i am cooler than you because i hold all the cards .	1
then he turned to the army and yelled , attack !	1
chapter 12 the monsters surged up the hill , blocking out kojas delirious laughter .	1
seth shouted , stay together , dont get separated !	1
a troll charged at me and i jumped to the side .	1
i looked up and saw that emily , jason , and seth had been swallowed by the rushing creatures .	1
so much for that plan .	1
emily !	1
i yelled but my voice was drowned out .	1
i saw a flash of fire off to the side .	1
emily was fine .	1
i twisted around so that the troll charged past me .	1
i turned and plunged my knife into its back before it could respond and it fell to the ground .	1
i felt pain flare in my right foot and looked down to see a frost beast with its teeth in my leg .	1
when i tried to pull away , in bit down harder .	1
ow , i yelped .	1
ow , ow , ow , get the heck off me !	1
i slashed downward and the frost beast let go of my leg .	1
it zipped between my legs and launched itself at my left leg .	1
i stepped to the side and slammed my foot on the beasts back .	1
it yipped and went still .	1
i raced through the crowds , jumping and ducking .	1
i looked over my shoulder and up the hill , wishing i could escape all the bodies that were pressed together in combat .	1
then i rammed into one .	1
what the heck ?	1
i fell on my butt and blinked as jason picked himself off the ground .	1
sorry , i said and stood up .	1
watch where youre going jazell , look out !	1
jason suddenly yelled .	1
i dove onto the ground and felt the monster brush past me .	1
i looked up to see jason rolling on the ground before jumping on the faery jerks back .	1
he yelled at jason right before i saw the knife disappear somewhere in his neck .	1
the faerys yells turned to screams and then nothing .	1
he fell to the ground and jason brushed himself off .	1
you okay , jazell ?	1
he asked me and held out a hand .	1
i took his hand and he pulled me up .	1
yup , im just peachy .	1
at least you can use sarcasm in a time like this , he said and started to fight his way through the crowd .	1
i followed him quickly .	1
i had no desire to become separated again .	1
when cant you use sarcasm ?	1
i asked loudly .	1
he didnt reply to me because he had spotted emily .	1
she was slowly backing up with her palms out .	1
fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast .	1
the beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth .	1
emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist .	1
she was holding up fine but i didnt know how much longer .	1
i strung my bow and released an arrow .	1
it pierced the frost beasts pelt and it fell to the ground .	1
emily turned to me with huge , confused eyes .	1
she mouthed the words , thank you .	1
i nodded in response .	1
jason threw his knife at the troll and it landed in its leg .	1
the troll collapsed on the ground and emily raised her hands in the air .	1
the ground rumbled and the troll disappeared in the dirt .	1
i ran over to her and hugged her .	1
thank goodness we found you .	1
i looked at her pale face and frowned .	1
are you okay ?	1
she nodded vigorously .	1
yes , its just hard work to use my magic .	1
i need a lot of concentration .	1
we all ducked behind a half-dead tree to escape from the swarms of monsters .	1
we were breathing heavily .	1
i leaned my head against the trees cold bark , wanting to disappear from it all .	1
wheres seth ?	1
emily asked .	1
i raised my head .	1
we havent found him yet .	1
her eyes widened .	1
what do you mean , you havent found him yet ?	1
i crashed into jazell , who was doing , like , forty , jason pointed to me .	1
then we both found you fighting beasts with your fiery fingertips of death .	1
she raised an eyebrow .	1
fiery fingertips of death ?	1
hey , he shrugged , jazells sarcasm is contagious .	1
anyway , we better find seth before he gets into some serious trouble , i said , and walked off .	1
i went farther down the hill and the fighting spread out more .	1
i tripped on a dead root and cursed as i stood back up .	1
the slope started to even out more and the trees popped up again .	1
be careful .	1
i stopped .	1
the voice had come out of nowhere .	1
the time is near .	1
the voice whispered as faintly as the breeze .	1
what , i thought , was that ?	1
you must stop it .	1
i gritted my teeth in annoyance .	1
im sick and tired of your riddles , whoever you are .	1
just give me a straight answer or i cant do anything .	1
it all comes down to this .	1
what is coming ?	1
i cried out in frustration .	1
it didnt reply to me again , so i continued to walk down the hill .	1
what did i have to stop ?	1
what was so important ?	1
why wasnt i allowed a straight answer in this stupid world ?	1
i heard a faint clang ahead .	1
i walked faster and with ever step the noise got louder .	1
when the ground became completely flat , i stopped at the scene in front of me .	1
seth spun around , bringing his sword up to block kojas swords .	1
kojas pulled his swords back and slashed through the air .	1
seth ducked and stabbed at his opponents middle .	1
kojas brought his sword down and swiped seths .	1
it twisted out of seths grip and fell to the ground .	1
i wanted to scream , but i couldnt .	1
i was frozen in fear .	1
seth dashed to his sword , hand out stretched .	1
then kojas raised a hand and something dark shot out of it .	1
it slammed into seths side and he fell to the ground .	1
no !	1
i wanted to scream .	1
no , seth !	1
i saw seth squirm as kojas walked towards him .	1
i heard him chuckle .	1
seth , kojas said .	1
seth , oh when will you learn ?	1
seth groaned and grabbed at his sword , but kojas kicked it away .	1
then he slashed his sword across seths face .	1
i saw the thin blue line well up on his cheek .	1
kojas laughed .	1
you cant beat me ; you can never be safe .	1
seth pushed himself up and dove for his sword , which was off to the side .	1
kojas flicked his sword down and i saw seth flinch .	1
he looked at his arm in amazement where a deep cut had sliced through his clothes .	1
he pressed his fingers on his arm to stop the blood and continued to scoot towards the sword .	1
kojas stepped to the side and blocked his path .	1
seth gazed up at him and i saw his eyes blaze in hate .	1
what do you want ?	1
he snarled .	1
seth , i think you know what i want .	1
never !	1
the faery chuckled and i saw his greasy hair bounce up and down .	1
you seriously think that i assumed you would walk away with me ?	1
oh , i had no intention of it being this simple .	1
i knew what he meant , and i yanked my bow off .	1
i pulled my arrow out and notched it , aiming it at kojas back .	1
jazell , wait !	1
i didnt turn around as emily and jason skidded to a halt behind me .	1
i didnt drop my bow either .	1
wait jazell , she panted .	1
i tightened my grip .	1
why ?	1
hes going to try to take seth .	1
we have to stop him .	1
then i released my arrow .	1
its an understatement to say all hell broke loose .	1
in my opinion , it was way crazier than that .	1
kojas sidestepped my arrow and it disappeared somewhere in the trees .	1
emily raised her hands and roots twisted upward , trying to encase kojas but he kept slashing them away .	1
jason attempted to distract him by running around throwing knives at him but i think jason was too busy ducking the black stuff that shot out of kojas hands .	1
i ran right past all of them and towards seth .	1
i knelt down and smacked him across his good cheek .	1
ow , what was that for ?	1
he grunted .	1
i dont have enough bruises for your liking ?	1
thats for being a jerk and not telling us you were going to fight kojas on your own , i said angrily .	1
hey in my defense , he found me first .	1
i opened my mouth to say something smart , but i hear emily scream .	1
i turned around to see jason crash into a tree and not move .	1
seth jumped up and grabbed his sword from the ground .	1
he ran for kojas .	1
kojas turned around and looked like a kid on christmas morning .	1
he raised his sword to block seths blow .	1
seth pulled back and parried kojas swing .	1
emily , is he okay ?	1
i yelled .	1
she looked up and nodded to me .	1
i turned back around to see kojas slash seth across the stomach .	1
thats when i screamed .	1
seth fell to his knees , holding his midsection .	1
his sword fell out of his grip and to the ground .	1
kojas grinned in triumph and kicked seth to the ground .	1
i screamed again , when he didnt move .	1
at last , kojas breathed .	1
monster !	1
i cried .	1
youre a monster !	1
he didnt answer me .	1
i looked up the hill to see a bunch of faery jerks running down the hill towards us .	1
emily stood in front of jason and raised her hands .	1
i notched an arrow and aimed .	1
dust kicked up everywhere as i aimed blindly .	1
i heard one of them shout out in pain .	1
i shot another and another , anger burning through me .	1
stop him .	1
i turned around and saw seths body through the dust .	1
he looked up at me and mouthed , jazell .	1
seth !	1
i yelled .	1
then the dust and darkness swallowed him up until i couldnt see him at all .	1
epilogue i padded silently through the long , dark halls .	1
emily and jason walked wordlessly by my side .	1
no one spoke because there was nothing to say , and so much to say , at the same time .	1
it had been almost a day since seth disappeared .	1
a day since kojas took him .	1
i had told him , when he had first said that kojas wanted to use him that he didnt have to worry .	1
i should have known that kojas would do anything to get him , and now seth was gone .	1
after he had been taken and jason had awakened , the faery jerks had scattered .	1
then a light pixie had showed up , the same one who had saved my life a while ago , and led us all the way to her majestys place .	1
she was apparently the queen but she was nothing like a stuck up royal leader .	1
she was more like a warrior who lead igneeria in the good times .	1
she was really nice but when we had met her , i was in an awful mood .	1
no one blamed me ; i had just watched one of my best friends get beat up and taken right before my eyes .	1
her majesty said to return in the morning when i would hopefully be in a better mood .	1
so jason , emily and i walked to her throne room .	1
emily pushed open the door and queen crystalla turned to us .	1
she wasnt someone who youd expect to be named crystalla .	1
she was more of the tough type .	1
jazell , emily and jason !	1
crystalla beamed .	1
im so happy you can finally join us !	1
crystalla was dressed in a hunting jacket with a dark blue top underneath .	1
she had dark green pants with simple brown boots .	1
a gleaming sword was slung on her back .	1
my heart ached because she somewhat resembled seth .	1
man , i missed his stubbornness .	1
yup were happy too , emily said with a sigh .	1
so , um , what did you need ?	1
i asked .	1
she nodded .	1
right , you must meet your destiny .	1
its a shame the other one couldnt be here right now .	1
she looked upset but she wiped it away with a small smile .	1
follow me , please .	1
we followed without any words .	1
we went outside and past some light pixies that were milling around the very small garden .	1
one waved to me and i raised my hand in greeting .	1
crystalla walked into a small , dark building and i followed .	1
it opened into a room with a high , glass ceiling .	1
ahead of us were four doors , each with a symbol i couldnt see from here .	1
crystalla stopped and faced us .	1
find the door with your symbol on it .	1
uh , jason raised his hand sheepishly , how do we know which symbol is ours ?	1
she smiled .	1
you will know .	1
she motioned for us to move up to the doors .	1
i walked slowly and leaned forward to see the symbol .	1
amazingly , i walked right up to the one with an arrow on it .	1
i looked to the left and saw a door with a sword on it .	1
i sighed and pushed open my door .	1
the small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer .	1
the room was dark and cold , with dust in the air .	1
i was wondering when you would get here , a familiar voice said .	1
i jumped and looked into one of the corners .	1
the girl from my dreams walked out , shimmering .	1
she smiled and i then noticed the bow hanging on her back with a quiver of arrows .	1
you know how you asked for my name before ?	1
i can tell you now , she said .	1
actually , i can tell you a lot .	1
great , im all ears .	1
she laughed .	1
my name is june and like you , i was once a full human .	1
youre a half-ling ?	1
i asked in amazement .	1
i was a half-ling. , june corrected me .	1
im dead now .	1
but i can still speak to you because you have to complete the job i did before with my friends .	1
wow , back up a second , i said quickly .	1
youre dead ?	1
she tapped her foot impatiently .	1
do you know how long ago i defeated kojas ?	1
it must have been over one hundred years ago .	1
wow , that was a long time ago , i said .	1
you defeated kojas ?	1
june sighed in frustration .	1
did you pay any attention to anything ?	1
mackenzie , david , mark and i beat kojas the first time he appeared .	1
it wasnt easy ; let me tell you that right now .	1
how did you die ?	1
mark died of a wound after we beat kojas .	1
he was too weak to live .	1
david and i died in an ambush of what was left of kojas army .	1
mackenzie died from a fatal fall , i dont remember how .	1
oh , i said and rubbed my neck .	1
i dont want to be rude , but do you need to tell me anything else ?	1
i have to try to come up with a few explanations for back home .	1
a lot of explanations .	1
june walked towards me until she was standing right in front .	1
i could almost see through her body , which was really starting to freak me out .	1
you have to get back seth , she whispered .	1
i know david was supposed to see him right now and i know hes disappointed .	1
you cant beat kojas without the four of you .	1
you cant unleash the nights circle without all of you .	1
and without the nights circle , you can not destroy kojas forever .	1
i started to shake with the intensity of it all .	1
if the nights circle destroys kojas forever , why is he still here ?	1
june backed up a bit .	1
we think that our nights circle wasnt strong enough because mark was seriously injured .	1
but no problem , you guys have to destroy him now .	1
she must have seen me shaking because she added , no pressure .	1
no pressure ?	1
i practically squeaked .	1
you just put the fate of both worlds on my shoulders .	1
no , she said , i put the fate of both worlds on all four of your shoulders .	1
alright , is that all ?	1
i asked , eager to leave .	1
june nodded and i turned to open the door .	1
i was just about to turn the handle when she said , jazell , dont be scared to bring out your emotions .	1
they make you stronger .	1
i looked over my shoulder to see june standing stiffly .	1
thanks , i whispered .	1
thanks june .	1
good luck , jazell .	1
i opened the door and saw that emily and jason were also coming out of their rooms .	1
emily looked a little shaken but she gave me a thumbs-up .	1
good luck , junes voice whispered one more time .	1
yeah , i was going to need it .	1
big time .	1
seth , im coming , i thought , and i meant it .	1
hold on .	1
then i walked out to face my destiny .	1

the sky shone sapphire behind the lacy branches , and the only other life along this back road were two tawny cows grazing in the silver white grass of the ditch .	1
behind them ran the same crumbling adobe wall the boy saw every day as he walked this way out of town for the afternoon session at the christian school his parents sent him to .	1
today was tuesday , and that meant bible class .	1
in one coffee-colored hand , the boy clutched his fat black bible with gilded letters , a present from his parents on his last birthday , fourteen .	1
he shuffled slowly along the road , feeling the bible burn into his fingertips , trying not to free the furious tears scalding the back of his eyes .	1
he should leave the bible here in the ditch by the cows .	1
because now the boy knew : none of it really mattered .	1
oh , he was quite sure there was justice and virtue in the world , and he intended to find it .	1
but it was not here .	1
not in this book , and not in anything that his parents had ever taught him about it .	1
he had finally told them what had happened and they did n't care .	1
they had n't moved a finger to help .	1
the boy 's hazel eyes narrowed and his lower lip quivered like a baby 's .	1
what in the world was he supposed to do now ?	1
and then he saw the blackened fingers rising from the silky grass in the ditch .	1
the boy 's mouth opened in slow motion and his whole world congealed to frozen ; then he lurched forward towards the horrible sight , heard his heavy bible thump to the dirt .	1
the fingers were a child 's , even darker than his own , blackened by dirt .	1
the boy fell to his knees on the sharp stones of the road and flung the grass aside , shaking so badly he could hardly breathe .	1
another boy was sprawled face-up in the ditch , face bloodied and swollen , unmistakably dead .	1
the fingers had n't belonged to a small child , but to someone the boy 's own age , dressed in torn navy sweat pants and lying here dead in the ditch on the road to the christian school .	1
oceans of bile rose up in the boy 's throat and he collapsed into the white grass , emptying his stomach into the weeds until he felt himself heave , insides scraped dry .	1
it was him , the boy 's best friend .	1
the one no one cared about .	1
the boy forced himself to stand up , tears dripping off his chin and onto the embroidered gold cross of his white school uniform .	1
his friend was dead , and he had n't been able to stop this .	1
wiping his chin on one sleeve , the boy began to march back towards town , stepping over the muddy , crumpled bible .	1
he would take his stuff from his parents ' house and leave .	1
if he never saw them again , that would be just fine .	1
the bible would be staying here .	1
1 purple bolivia 2017 when pastor martir mentioned that the quechua bible conference was a ways out in the bolivian countryside , he certainly had n't been kidding .	1
by her calculations , eight hours had gone by since they left the vibrant garden city of cochabamba , climbing higher and higher into the clouds .	1
wara cadogan slit her eyes open and squinted around the darkened interior of the jeep .	1
the windowpanes had frosted now that the sun hid behind the jagged peaks of the andes .	1
an elbow jabbed her side and wara heard her friend nazaret martir yawn , a squeaky , muffled sound that caused her father , pastor martir , to glance at both girls in the rearview mirror .	1
`` we 'll be there any second , '' he told them , much too chipper after being cooped up in the jeep all day .	1
`` i know it 's freezing now , but soon we 'll get you warmed up .	1
it 's a long hike . ''	1
wara stuffed her numb hands into the sleeves of her alpaca sweater and bit her lip .	1
why had she let herself be talked into this ?	1
she loved the martirs , and their large family had basically adopted wara during the six years she 'd been a missionary here in bolivia .	1
as a linguistics major , wara usually jumped at any chance to travel out into the countryside and practice speaking quechua .	1
so when pastor martir said he needed her to translate from spanish to quechua at this conference in potosi , wara had enthusiastically answered , `` why not ? ''	1
bad idea .	1
a very bad idea .	1
a bible conference , wara ?	1
what were you thinking ?	1
pastor martir steered the jeep into a cavernous rut , and wara felt her jaw snap at the impact .	1
the turquoise knit cap she wore slid over one eye .	1
she pushed the hat back into position as a low moan came from the back seat .	1
if she were n't so stressed , wara would have grinned .	1
her best guy friend noah was waking up from his perch back with the luggage .	1
`` where are we ? ''	1
she heard him mutter under his breath .	1
`` this place looks like the twilight zone . ''	1
one long arm brushed wara 's ear as he reached up to clear frost from her window .	1
not a single light outside , and the murky sky tossed off thick shadows .	1
the skeletal remains of a tree rose up out of the gravel path , beckoning the jeep forward .	1
noah was right : it looked downright freaky out there .	1
pushing back her nervousness about the whole bible conference thing , wara turned towards the back seat .	1
despite the rough ride , noah was looking content , emerald green eyes glinting in the moonlight .	1
his sandy , shoulder-length hair was littered with straw and the poor guy really had to hunch over to fit his frame in the tight space on top of the luggage .	1
at first glance , noah hearst might give off the aura of surfer dude , but he was n't really full of muscle .	1
and he was n't fat .	1
noah was just a big guy .	1
plus , there were n't really a lot of surfers in ohio , where noah was from .	1
`` did you have a nice nap back there with the potatoes ? ''	1
she asked .	1
noah tried to stretch , then grimaced and gave up .	1
`` yeah .	1
i guess . ''	1
he glanced around the car , took in pastor martir and two skinny quechua-speaking bible school students in the front , wara and nazaret in the middle seat .	1
`` i guess i 'll be the one carrying this stuff up to the conference for our lunch .	1
seriously , that 's about all i 'll be good for .	1
nazaret 's dad must be thrilled he got you to translate , though .	1
word on the street is you speak quechua like a native . ''	1
true .	1
despite the cold , wara felt her armpits prick .	1
she used to be good at this .	1
the first year wara lived in bolivia , she worked teaching bible lessons to ladies in quechua and helped at a ton of children 's bible clubs around the city .	1
but then everything happened .	1
she left the country for four months to try to get things together , and when she came back she was teaching literacy classes to quechua women .	1
and volunteering at the home for children with aids that the martir family ran .	1
she did n't teach about the bible anymore , because that would just make her a hypocrite .	1
and noah , good friend that he was , never asked .	1
`` i can never get over how lucky you are , '' noah was going on .	1
`` sounding so bolivian , and looking it too .	1
can you imagine anyone ever mixing me up with a bolivian ? ''	1
`` uh , no . ''	1
wara raised an eyebrow and him and stifled a smile .	1
`` i would be seriously worried about anybody who thought you were bolivian . ''	1
in addition to being tall and blond with skin that crisped red in the strong cochabamba sun , noah had studied spanish in spain .	1
whenever the guy spoke spanish , it came out with a lisp that , to bolivians , sounded really silly .	1
noah had good reason to be jealous of wara .	1
besides teaching her quechua from the time she was a baby , wara 's quechua grandmother from peru had passed along some of her color .	1
wara 's skin was a light tan that bronzed in the sun .	1
behind trendy maroon glasses , her eyes were honey brown .	1
and her brown hair , now sporting an uneven cut with burgundy highlights , let her fit right in with her bolivian friends .	1
`` i think i 'm getting a cold , '' nazaret announced smally from wara 's side .	1
wara turned back to her and took in her friend 's pale , heart-shaped face framed in dyed blond ringlets .	1
she was sheathed in a puffy pink coat , mounds of pink scarves , and a snow white knit hat with pale pink sparkles .	1
the jeep hit another hard rut just as nazaret sneezed , a cute , shrill little sound that was all but muffled in tiny pink alpaca mittens .	1
`` i hov i can still help you wif de kids , '' she sniffled , bleary hazel eyes turned on noah , who patted her on the white knit cap with a few encouraging words .	1
they all jerked to attention as the jeep braked to a halt in a sudden spray of gravel .	1
when the group piled out of the car , they discovered the air outside the car was even colder than inside .	1
even though it would look ridiculous , wara almost wished she was wearing snow pants , just like when she was little growing up in montana .	1
the frayed jeans and hippie tunic she had on under the alpaca sweater were not doing anything to keep her warm .	1
frozen fingers brushed lazily over her cheeks from the hulking mountains all around them .	1
off in the distance , something howled .	1
nazaret covered her nose with one mitten to muffle another sharp sneeze and it echoed off the mountains in the night .	1
`` 'scuse me . ''	1
noah cheerfully pushed past wara , carting a gigantic burlap sack of potatoes .	1
`` coming through , '' nazaret 's father followed him , hauling a second bag of something edible .	1
wara huddled next to nazaret for a minute , watching as the guys hefted the food and sleeping bags onto a haggle of scrawny burros .	1
a few quechua guys in black jackets and slacks had materialized from an adobe hut and were helping to arrange everything on the donkeys by the light of a shimmering bonfire .	1
pastor martir , who came every year to preach at this rural bible conference in potosi , said that it was best to climb the mountain at night , when it was cooler .	1
right now , wara really hoped he knew what he was talking about .	1
they still had a seven-hour hike ahead of them , up the forested granite .	1
she stifled a heavy yawn and fixed her gaze on the diamond stars .	1
in the morning , she woke up to scruffy feathers and a beak .	1
a chicken scratched through the pebbles right outside the crumbling adobe wall of the community school house where she and the others had crashed for a few hours after the hike .	1
the local christians had gone to all the trouble of fixing up wooden pallets with woolen blankets here at the school , so their guests could have a private place to stay .	1
wara knew they had gone to a lot of trouble and hated to admit that it honestly had n't been worth going to sleep .	1
a well-organized army of fleas had taken up residence in the wool blankets long before she had , and she , noah , and nazaret had scratched and grumbled for a few hours before pastor martir coated their beds with raid .	1
maybe that was why now , with daylight streaming through the holes in the schoolhouse wall , it was so darn hard to move .	1
could you overdose on raid ?	1
wara kicked off the sleeping bag , grabbed her glasses from the dirt floor , and pulled herself to sitting .	1
pastor martir was already gone , probably outside at some morning prayer vigil with the quechua christians .	1
nazaret curled on her plank bed , still snoring .	1
noah 's long legs stuck out the end of his unzipped sleeping bag , leaving his filthy socked feet sprawled in the dirt near giant maroon nike tennis shoes .	1
when she moved to stand up , the powdery remains of dried up fleas shifted on the navy fleece of the sleeping bag .	1
eeww .	1
wara had to grin at the sight of those dried bugs .	1
she really loved these kind of trips .	1
she dusted her bare feet off on the edge of her jeans and stuffed her sockless feet into doc marten boots , hoping to find someplace outside to use the bathroom before everyone else got up .	1
a waist-high cluster of boulders overlooking the valley below turned out to be the best option for privacy .	1
she brushed her teeth with water from a dented bottle of pura vida and spit off into the deserted valley .	1
trailing wisps of clouds slithered around boulders below .	1
the only structures visible were the schoolhouse where she had slept and two sturdy adobe houses a little way down the rounded path .	1
a quechua lady with a huge smile was waiting in the school with a breakfast of sweet purple corn drink and boiled eggs .	1
she wore a knee-length circle skirt called a pollera , this one a soft sage green .	1
despite the morning chill , her mahogany legs were bare and she wore scuffed black plastic ballet flats .	1
she did have on a warm cardigan over the lacy white blouse quechua ladies always wore .	1
the lady bringing breakfast introduced herself as doa petronia and patted wara on the forearm in greeting , telling her how happy she was that god had brought wara to this conference .	1
wara smiled back wanly , even though it was a lot of fun to be speaking quechua up in the mountains again .	1
she still did n't feel good about the idea of her being part of this bible conference , acting like she was all sweet and good here with pastor martir , noah and the bible school students .	1
she felt like a fake .	1
still queasy , she mumbled something appropriate and tried to get down the purple api and an egg .	1
they assigned her to help noah , who was in charge of the kids while their parents attended bible classes .	1
wara had already seen him in action many times during the five years they 'd been friends , teaching bible stories to kids at the martirs ' aids center or hanging out with a little homeless kid in downtown cochabamba .	1
within minutes , noah had the group of kids sitting on a grassy knoll and captivated by bible songs with actions .	1
then he made wara come stand next to him to translate a story into quechua , one about jesus calming the stormy sea .	1
she grew up in church and could rattle off this story by heart , in english , spanish , or quechua .	1
but there was no way she could keep a group of kids glued to her every word the way noah did .	1
she ignored the sick feeling in her stomach and stood next to noah , feeling little and insignificant at five foot five next to his six foot three .	1
all she had to do was tell noah 's story to the kids in quechua .	1
her own failings could n't ruin the moment for the kids .	1
noah deserved to be listened to .	1
when the story was over , she could see in the kids ' eyes that they had imagined every peal of thunder , felt the shuddering of the splintered wooden boat on the open sea .	1
noah asked the kids to come up and stand at his side , one by one , to tell him what they were afraid of .	1
`` that we wo n't have enough to eat if hail destroys the crops , '' mumbled one almond-eyed little boy in a jade chullu cap .	1
`` i 'm afraid of the terrible goat that lives down the hill . ''	1
several muffled giggles scattered across the group .	1
`` of the thunder when it storms . ''	1
one short boy in a tattered soccer jersey trudged to the front when it was his turn and recited gravely , `` i 'm scared that my other brothers will become one of the missing , like my brother antonio . ''	1
wara scrunched up her face .	1
she had never heard anyone refer to someone who died as `` the missing '' before in quechua , but maybe it was a regional idiom .	1
she was going to have to ask around later to figure out if that was really how that phrase should be used .	1
i 'm such a nerd .	1
she blinked away thoughts of quechua grammar and brought her attention back to noah , who was beaming at the children , then her , waiting for her to translate .	1
`` you know , when i was little , '' he told the kids , `` there was this dog that lived a few houses away from mine , and he had really , really big teeth . ''	1
suddenly , strangely , noah slung an arm over wara 's shoulders , leaving the two of them facing the children together .	1
`` i want you to know kids , if jesus is with you , you do n't have to be scared of anything .	1
he 's stronger than anything in this world . ''	1
just as mesmerized by noah 's words as the kids , wara felt herself leaning into his side .	1
then the lesson was over .	1
`` thanks for translating , '' noah told her , then dropped his arm and smiled .	1
wara felt her heart do a very weird pitter-patter and she stared after him as he jogged off to chase some of the kids in a game of tag .	1
that attraction you 're feeling ?	1
she chided herself warily .	1
that 's just because noah is your friend .	1
you would never think of noah as anything more than a friend .	1
right ?	1
wara blinked , then squinted at noah , who was grabbing a giggling little kid around the shoulders and swinging him in the air .	1
she would be crazy to let herself think of noah as anything other than a friend .	1
he was much too goofy for anything else .	1
wara was always studying and was sometimes really grouchy .	1
noah was always so happy-go-lucky and watched way too many cartoons .	1
not exactly prince charming .	1
plus , he did n't really know her .	1
wara shook herself back to reality and headed back down towards the house , thinking she should probably help the ladies fix lunch .	1
the cloud-covered valley writhed with mist , licking the emerald grass at her feet .	1
it was hauntingly beautiful .	1
in the rocky dirt outside the main house she found a circle of quechua women squatting in their wide velvet pollera skirts around a plastic tub of potatoes .	1
the ladies skillfully attacked the miniscule purple and yellow-veined potatoes with paring knives , leaving the spuds without peel in seconds .	1
wara hunkered down next to the smiling lady from breakfast this morning , doa petronia .	1
wara had tried so hard to learn to peel potatoes like a respectable quechua woman should , but she usually ended up desecrating the potato , scraping half of it off into the scrap pile .	1
she fiddled around a little with the knife and a bumpy yellow potato , then decided to put her grammar question out there .	1
`` i was wondering about something one of the kids said .	1
if you say that your family member is the missing , does that mean that person died ? ''	1
doa petronia 's long blade faltered mid-peel and she reached up with one work-roughed hand to flip a braid behind her back .	1
everyone fell silent .	1
`` you must have heard my son edgar talking , '' she finally nodded .	1
`` he 's only six but he is so worried about his older brother . ''	1
`` or maybe it was my juan marco talking about his older brother , '' interjected a more portly woman in a royal purple pollera .	1
a thick layer of fat rolled out of the waist of her skirt , blanketed with the silky white undershirt the ladies wore under their short lace blouses .	1
she jerked her chin towards doa petronia .	1
`` she and i both have older sons , teenagers .	1
three months ago , the boys both went away , never to be heard from again . ''	1
`` went away ? ''	1
wara frowned .	1
`` we call them 'the missing ' . ''	1
doa petronia looked wara directly in the eye .	1
`` the boys went into llallagua to sell some potatoes , but on completely different days .	1
we never heard from them again .	1
we do not know where they could have gone .	1
that is why we call them and the other boys 'the missing ' . ''	1
`` what other boys ? ''	1
the two women eyed each other soberly .	1
`` from all over the mountains , many different communities .	1
all missing . ''	1
wara did n't know what to say .	1
how could these women 's sons , and boys from other communities too , just be gone ?	1
the pain in the women 's black eyes was evident , and wara felt horrible .	1
how many of the people here at the bible conference had a son or brother who had just disappeared ?	1
i am really glad nazaret is still off teaching somewhere .	1
i hope she has n't already heard about this .	1
the martirs were a busy household of six kids , but once upon a time there had been seven .	1
wara knew nazaret 's older brother had run away when he was a teenager , and she knew the serious , skinny oldest martir only from his faded photograph in a frame on nazaret 's dresser .	1
talking about missing kids was always enough to start nazaret weeping .	1
wara really hoped her friend would n't hear about this .	1
it would only make her think of her brother , the missing boy who was probably never going to come home .	1
she could identify a little with that kid in the picture , because sometimes , when she thought too much about things , wara just wanted to run away from here and start over .	1
except the past always follows you .	1
noah was running up the hill panting , with a hundred screaming quechua kids close on his heels .	1
even if she wanted to be with noah , she would never deserve him .	1
there were some things that even time could n't erase .	1
2 gaudy gold peshawar , pakistan 2017 alejo perched above the ancient labyrinth that was old city peshawar , counting down the seconds until he would take a man 's life .	1
the tri-colored apartment complex where he waited soared to the cloudless sky , cream , cinnamon , and pistachio .	1
a giant block of neapolitan ice cream , sizzling under the peshawar heat .	1
in a dusty courtyard with solid walls below , the three men who marched between grave pakistani police were mere specks to alejo .	1
gabriel was at the scope , reporting the details of the scene below ; benjamin lay prone as alejo did , both of them one with the black rifles propped on sandbags .	1
`` so , they just entered the courtyard , '' gabriel said softly .	1
sweat poured down his pale face from the tightly-wrapped black turban .	1
they were alone on the cement rooftop high over peshawar , and abandoned the pashto language for their native spanish .	1
`` the paki police are pretty nervous .	1
ok !	1
here come the americans .	1
they 've all got bullet-proof vests . ''	1
gabriel 's bony fingers tightened on the scope and his voice rose with excitement .	1
not surprising .	1
the u.s. army would n't want any crazy talibs to take out their precious little prisoners before they get to `` justice '' now , would they ?	1
but how many years would the young soldiers get for murdering afghan children across the border and posting bloody trophy pictures on the internet ?	1
three years in a comfy cell with three meals a day ?	1
that was more than most afghan children could dream of .	1
security was tight around that little compound with the courtyard , as the whole surrounding area would like to see the american soldiers in pakistani custody mutilated and dead .	1
but no one would expect a shot to come from this distance .	1
a cacophony of horns blasted from the matchbox cars snaking along below .	1
the sound would cover the shot perfectly .	1
alejo shifted one leg , ever so slightly , letting blood flow back into one of his thighs that had been riding a rock for the past half-hour .	1
`` targets are moving towards the mark , '' gabriel said calmly .	1
he rolled into place in the line of three men on their stomachs and positioned his gun on the sandbag .	1
the three of them gazed through the gun scopes now at the american prisoners , blond and thin inside their bullet-proof vests .	1
alejo evened his breathing and willed his weak arm still .	1
he drew a slow lungful of air , then held it , finger exact and deathly-still on the trigger .	1
he heard each beat of his heart echo in his ear , steady and slow .	1
he waited until one heartbeat had just drummed , then murmured in the space between , `` now . ''	1
below in the old city , the timing was perfect .	1
an ornately-painted bus lumbering around the corner of the compound honked and belched black smoke , just as alejo 's bullet entered the medulla oblongata at the base of the middle soldier 's skull and he slumped to the dirt in a crimson mist .	1
the other two collapsed on top of him , the part of their brains that controls involuntary movements effectively destroyed .	1
it took a full five seconds for all hell to break loose in the courtyard as mustachioed policemen and high-up american officials all turned up dust diving for cover .	1
alejo could tell there was no need to take a second shot .	1
he felt cold , and lowered the rifle from his eyes , staring at the dim outline of the mountains encircling the city .	1
still lying low , he pulled a small gray cell phone from his pocket and punched a button .	1
ishmael khan , recruiter from the prism and alejo 's handler , would be pacing the floor in his mansion until he heard the soldiers were dead .	1
alejo set his jaw , then motioned to benjamin and gabriel .	1
they slunk into the tri-color apartment building and into a room filled with grimy shalwar kameezs , ammunition , and cigarette butts .	1
afghan-made cigarettes .	1
this was the kind of hole taliban fighters always frequented , and whoever one day discovered this place alejo had set up would not be surprised to see a slew of rifles on the kitchen table next to the moldering rice and half-eaten naan bread .	1
everyone in peshawar packed lead .	1
slick with sweat and fine concrete dust , the three men dumped their soiled shalwar kameezs with the rest of the filthy clothes on the bathroom floor and pulled on jeans and t-shirts , the clothes of upper-class pakistani students .	1
with bronze skin , wavy black hair , and perfect pashto , alejo never had problems passing as a pakistani on his many trips to the country .	1
the other two guys on his team were also from bolivia , a little lighter-skinned than alejo but they still passed as pakistani or afghani .	1
`` death to the infidels , '' gabriel grinned , stuffing wads of tattered rupee bills into a bag around his thin chest .	1
benjamin and alejo rolled their eyes .	1
`` goodness , i 'm just kidding . ''	1
gabriel flashed merry eyes at them and winked .	1
`` let 's get out of here . ''	1
the throbbing wail of a siren cut through the heat outside the apartment building , racing towards the murdered americans .	1
the white orb of midday sun still blazed through the murky haze of pollution over the city .	1
and less than twenty blocks away , three lives had just been extinguished .	1
they were getting away .	1
the three of them would walk through this entire maze of a city , get to the khan 's house , and report a successful mission .	1
alejo tried to tell himself he should be happy .	1
at least a little .	1
that night , the feast at ishmael khan 's house was bounteous .	1
alejo and his team sat on burgundy and ivory carpets , faced with silver platters of seared roti bread and lamb curry .	1
milky tea simmered in bone white porcelain , rich with sugar crystals and cardamom .	1
the rest of his team was having the time of their life in the marble hall of the khan 's mansion , but alejo needed to get out of there .	1
he made his excuses to the entire clan of khan relatives and navigated peshawar 's labyrinth streets back to the apartment that was always waiting for him here in pakistan .	1
alejo slammed and locked the heavy wooden door and pulled a couple of guns from under his clothes .	1
he tossed them onto the red silk bedspread , next to the heavy religious book with ornate golden swirls .	1
for a second the image shocked him , and he blanched , turning to scan the familiar studio-style apartment .	1
he was caged in by ornate , gold-painted furniture in the seventeenth century style , including a giant gilded wardrobe that could have doubled as a coffin for king tut .	1
feeling sick and angry , alejo collected the two weapons and the gilded arabic book and stuffed them in his black suitcase in the corner .	1
the suitcase was basically empty , ready to head back to bolivia after the trip to pakistan 's tribal area khan had insisted on the day after tomorrow .	1
peshawar 's bazaar was full of beautiful things , but alejo 's suitcase was empty because , honestly , there was no one to bring anything home to .	1
in the morning his team would meet here early .	1
it was time to plan the next job after pakistan , something that called from alejo 's native bolivia and refused to be laid to rest .	1
he really hoped that killing salazar after so many years would give him some kind of peace .	1
it probably would n't .	1
alejo tossed himself onto the silk bedspread fully dressed and forced his eyes closed in the darkness , fully expecting a reunion with nightmares .	1
and his dreams did n't disappoint him .	1
the first stabs of light through the golden curtains were a welcome relief .	1
alejo could always sleep through anything , a habit you learned fast when you spent your time doing the things he did .	1
but last night had been awful .	1
he dumped a bucket of cold water over his head in the shower , then exercised for a couple hours til his team arrived .	1
by the time the knock came on the apartment door , alejo felt like he 'd been awake forever .	1
`` asalaam alaikum , '' the guys greeted him in the traditional muslim way one by one , pushing past him into the apartment in pale cotton shalwar kameezs .	1
they were all muslims , having converted at different times in their lives : high school , university , graduate school .	1
benjamin , a doctor in bolivia , greeted alejo now with a droll smile and watchful eyes behind wire glasses .	1
he wore a little brown goatee , some kind of homage to the muslim tradition of big thick beards .	1
alejo never even tried to grow a beard , because the scattered stubble that appeared on his chin when he did n't shave for a week was really , really pathetic .	1
gabriel ambled into the apartment , grinned , and gave alejo one of those manly , back-clapping hugs just inside the door , the kind only latin guys can share .	1
gabriel was the skinny , fair-skinned guy who could make something from anything , a regular macgyver .	1
only twenty-three years old , he came from an arabic-background family in bolivia .	1
lzaro strode in next , wearing a deep blue shalwar kameez and a wool irish cap .	1
he was the newest guy on alejo 's team and had been sent over from puerto rico .	1
lzaro was one of those guys with a permanent tan from hours of camping and rock climbing and starting fires with nothing but sticks .	1
last came stalin , wheezing like a badger in the hazy peshawar pollution .	1
stalin was pasty , with round glasses and straggly lion-colored hair parted down the middle .	1
the guy was a phd in philosophy and comparative religions , so he came in handy , instructing new recruits in religion .	1
he also was n't a bad shot .	1
and yes , stalin 's parents , student revolutionaries , had actually named their infant son stalin lenin gomez .	1
this was his team .	1
the organization was called the prism , because they wanted to bring god 's light to the world .	1
like a prism scattered light into different colors , everyone in the organization had different talents , brought the light in different ways .	1
by the time alejo closed the door , his team was already making themselves comfortable .	1
the ghastly hue that hung over the golden room after the nightmares was no match for the aroma of the expensive colombian coffee gabriel was dumping into the coffeemaker .	1
benjamin produced fresh roti bread and goat cheese from a paper sack , and stalin was already stretching his legs out on the bed .	1
those socks looked like they had seen a good week of adventure in peshawar without a wash .	1
this was life in pakistan .	1
alejo felt a grin coming on , and he plopped down at the table , pushing aside an ugly vase of melon-colored , gold-coated roses .	1
`` the coffee smells strong today , '' gabriel nodded proudly .	1
`` just how we like it . ''	1
benjamin was quietly spreading goat cheese on a piece of bread , leaning his chair up against the wall next to alejo .	1
`` you seem to be in an especially good mood today , gabo .	1
have n't seen ambrin again , have you ? ''	1
gabriel 's green eyes took on saucer form and steaming coffee sloshed over the edge of his cup , wetting the top of his sandal on the way down .	1
stalin frowned and stopped stuffing grapes into his mouth from yet another sack of food the guys had carried in .	1
`` oh come on you guys !	1
leave poor gabriel alone !	1
you know he does n't like to be teased about ambrin . ''	1
gabriel had by now managed to get a grip on his coffee , but his usually-pale neck was now stained scarlet .	1
`` yeah you guys , we should n't even be talking about her .	1
you know i ca n't see her ? it would n't be right .	1
we 're not even engaged .	1
she knows i did n't mean to see her without a veil that one time . ''	1
`` but that 's when you fell in love , is n't it ? ''	1
benjamin commented without looking up from the cheese .	1
the whole team knew it was .	1
walking in the garden at the khan 's mansion one day , gabriel had run into ishmael 's niece , ambrin ? without a veil .	1
all the guys knew the story by now : sapphire eyes , and gabriel was instantly in love .	1
he was trying to get up the nerve to ask for her hand in marriage .	1
alejo let them go on about it for a while , because he really was dreading the thing he was about to bring up .	1
stalin , mouth still full of food , beat him to it .	1
`` so , '' he asked , polishing his little glasses on the tail of his long kameez shirt and spewing crumbs , `` who 's up to be the next speaker at our retreat ? ''	1
by speaker , he meant the next target .	1
lzaro , who always seemed to have an opinion about everything , set his feet apart on the floor and leaned forward to eye them all intensely .	1
`` i would nominate the southern baptist mission house back in cochabamba .	1
the world could n't be a much worse place without them , right ? ''	1
a grin stretched his tanned face and benjamin seemed to agree with him .	1
alejo fought a sour expression .	1
was the guy never going to let it go ?	1
he 'd only known lzaro for six months , and had already overdosed on the guy 's hatred for americans .	1
and missionaries .	1
word on the street was that lzaro had dated a cute missionary girl who later dumped him , thus the dislike of anything missionary or american .	1
alejo thought that lzaro just wanted an excuse to do whatever he wanted .	1
`` i 've already lined up the next speaker , '' alejo shook his head .	1
he tried to sit up straight but felt the three cups of coffee he 'd just downed settling in his gut like cool acid .	1
sweat trickled down his ribs and he saw blackened fingers through tall white grass , fought the urge to gag .	1
`` well whoever it is , i think it would be a lot more beneficial to get rid of all those missionaries preaching pie-in-the-sky while letting the world we live in go to hell . ''	1
lzaro again .	1
stalin was grinning , amused .	1
this was getting ridiculous .	1
`` it 's franco salazar , '' alejo said , cutting them off .	1
one of gabriel 's blond eyebrows rose .	1
`` the politician ?	1
what has that fat old dude done ?	1
everybody seems to like him back in bolivia .	1
he 's fashionable , drives a swell red sports car , and , they say , even has gold teeth . ''	1
his chipper grin died away at the look on alejo 's face .	1
`` tell us about him , '' benjamin pushed away the plate of bread and cheese .	1
`` guys , alejo knows what he 's talking about . ''	1
benjamin always respected him ; they had been friends for years , since they were both recruited into the prism together while getting masters degrees in london .	1
alejo knew his expression had morphed into something pained , but he could n't control it .	1
he felt the sun baking his neck again , like it had that day , while the breeze whistled through the tall white grass .	1
the smell of death threatened to engulf him here , fifteen years later .	1
i do know what i 'm talking about , but i would give anything not to know .	1
i do n't know if i can say this .	1
alejo did his best to focus , felt his face darken .	1
`` i 'll tell you .	1
and when i 'm done , you 'll know why salazar has to die . ''	1
his team leaned forward and , stuffing the nausea that came whenever he thought about ruben , alejo told them .	1
but he did n't tell them about ruben .	1
even without ruben , it was enough .	1
when alejo was finished , benjamin 's face burned .	1
stalin chewed on his lip , and gabriel looked ready to vomit .	1
`` he 's our next speaker , '' lzaro managed to croak .	1
`` it 's a good choice .	1
3 electric blue the city sat in the bowl of the andes , climbing up the foothills to the lavender peaks beyond .	1
cochabamba was sunny and bustling , infused with a rainbow of flowers and the smell of smog .	1
this city was her home for six years , and wara cadogan loved it .	1
back in downtown cochabamba a week after the trip to the mountains , wara entered caf amara wearing a green hippy dress over jeans and beat-up leather sandals .	1
the air was infused with coffee and cinnamon and vanilla icing and noah was already up front , tuning his honey-colored taylor guitar .	1
every friday he and a group of friends did live music at the downtown coffee shop his church owned .	1
noah threw wara a wave and she plopped down into a chair , ready to drink lots of coffee and rest after long day at the aids center with nazaret and her mom , noly .	1
a swish of fabric drew her attention to the tiny quechua lady at her side , holding a tray of empanadas .	1
wara 's mouth started to water at the sight of browned pastries , perfectly crimped edges embracing a center of melted cheese .	1
`` doa filomena , you know i ca n't resist empanadas , '' she told the older lady in quechua .	1
`` thank you .	1
how are you doing these days ? ''	1
doa filomena had a bent back and wrinkled skin that crinkled like parchment , especially around the eyes .	1
wara had never seen her without two thin gray braids twisted into a bun at the back of her head , and filomena always wore a thick navy blue cardigan over her lacy white blouse .	1
she was always thrilled to talk with a foreigner in her native quechua .	1
`` just fine , i 'm doing fine . ''	1
filomena patted wara on the shoulder , grasped her forearm delicately , and then patted again in the traditional quechua greeting .	1
`` i tell you , the lord is healing me of my arthritis .	1
i just pray , i 'm always praying , and i know that the lord is helping me feel better every day . ''	1
o-kay .	1
wonderful .	1
wara fought not to arch an eyebrow .	1
the lady 's faith was ? nice .	1
but she knew about the gigantic megachurch doa filomena was a part of , and all the speaking in tongues and mad tambourine playing that went on in that place honestly freaked wara out .	1
but who was she to judge , right ?	1
`` i 'm glad you 're feeling better .	1
and thanks for the empanada . ''	1
the older lady nodded with smiling , crinkly eyes and headed back towards the kitchen .	1
just as tiago pushed his way through the caf door , sending little chimes dinging .	1
tiago was a guy of maybe nineteen with a boyish smile and black baggy jeans with chains .	1
he was skinny as a rail and wara wondered when the kid ever ate .	1
the reason she knew tiago was because he was usually found smoking with a boyfriend outside the door of the neighboring coffee shop , caf paris , known for catering to homosexuals .	1
he grinned at her when he saw her , showing off the metal stud in his tongue .	1
another guy wara had never seen before was trailing tiago into caf amara , and the two of them stopped in front of wara 's table .	1
`` hey , there , '' tiago drew out the greeting with a sly smile .	1
noah meandered over to say hi to the guys too , still carrying his taylor guitar .	1
`` this is my new friend rudolf , from germany , '' tiago grinned .	1
`` he 's over here studying spanish , and i told him you guys were nice .	1
how 's it going noah ? ''	1
tiago shook noah 's hand and wara took in the new guy .	1
rudolf had a very clean-shaven german jaw and wore a preppy gray sweater and dark jeans .	1
he also shook noah and wara 's hands with a grin , going on about what a great city cochabamba was .	1
`` and one of the coolest coffee shops here is where you 're standing right now , my friend , '' tiago jumped in .	1
`` this girl right here , wara ?	1
she is always making me up free food from the kitchen .	1
nachos , little pizzas ? her quesadillas rock . ''	1
he punched wara in the shoulder , then turned his attention to noah .	1
`` so , we 're hanging out next door , but we thought we 'd come over and see if you wanted to have a drink with us .	1
you 're not singing til later , right ? ''	1
noah blinked .	1
`` uh , sure .	1
we could have a drink .	1
it 's only 9 now , right ? ''	1
alarm bells were going on in wara 's heard .	1
noah 's eyes were friendly and clueless , and he probably would n't be able to tell if someone was flirting with him to save his life .	1
`` i 'll come with you , '' she offered , trying not to grit her teeth .	1
`` sure , wara , that 'd be great . ''	1
noah smiled at her so warmly her knees actually went weak .	1
but then she caught herself and angrily kicked herself into reality .	1
noah thought she was a nice girl , just another missionary with a pure heart for serving the lord .	1
what if he ever found out ?	1
she could never be with someone like him .	1
`` yeah , i 'll definitely come with you guys , '' she repeated morosely as she followed them out the door .	1
`` i could use a good drink . ''	1
for a moment the relative silence of the darkened street shocked wara as the door to caf amara thudded closed behind them .	1
she crossed the pavement with the guys , towards the blue-toned beehive that was caf paris next door .	1
just inside the door , the throbbing techno music reverberated inside her chest and the dim lighting confused her .	1
noah leaned back and spoke into her ear .	1
`` we 'll just stay a little while , be friendly , go back .	1
thanks for coming .	1
i was feeling a little awkward . ''	1
`` no problem , '' wara hissed back , rolling her eyes .	1
some of the guys scooted over to make room for them on the electric blue barstools , and wara noticed that rudolf somehow switched seats with another guy next to him , ending up next to noah .	1
oh great .	1
wara had never actually been inside this caf before , and she took in the antique plaster ceiling with low-hanging bulbs covered in blue glass squares , sending an eerie , ghostly light around the long room .	1
the bar , sporting neon signs for mostly european beers , was by far the busiest area of the caf .	1
`` oh , '' she twisted around , realizing that the bartender was asking her what she wanted , `` i want a taquia . ''	1
she plopped down on the empty barstool next to noah , who turned away from rudolf as he heard her order for bolivian beer .	1
`` i did n't know you drank . ''	1
`` hardly ever do , '' wara answered coolly , flushing as she heard the solid clink of her glass mug of taquia hit the bar .	1
she knew this was going to be a bad idea , just knew it .	1
but she had n't had a beer in five years , and if there ever was a time for it , it might be now .	1
`` are you gon na have anything ? ''	1
`` i 'll get it , '' rudolf jumped in , offering to pay for noah 's drink .	1
`` you like taquia ? ''	1
wara hoped her grimace was discreet , and she tried to hide it by downing a good half of her beer , quickly followed by the other half .	1
noah , rudolf , and the other guys were talking away , covering everything from rudolf 's spanish studies here in cochabamba to what kind of music noah liked .	1
i have got to get noah out of here , wara thought as she ordered a cuba libre .	1
just got to watch for my chance ?	1
she already felt the effects of the alcohol as the rum with coke went down , but all in all , she felt pretty good .	1
if noah was n't in danger of being picked up , this would actually be kind of fun .	1
another fifteen minutes went by , which wara filled with another cuba libre and a whole lot of moody thoughts .	1
and then she heard noah 's voice .	1
`` hey , no .	1
i 'm not ? i just came here to hang out . ''	1
wara realized noah was stammering .	1
she whirled around to see rudolf leaning way , way too close .	1
noah 's neck had turned absolutely crimson , and his fingers twitched on the edge of the bar stool .	1
all right , that 's it !	1
that 's my friend there !	1
she shot up from her seat and slid onto noah 's lap , wrapping her fingers around the back of his neck .	1
wara to the rescue !	1
`` that 's right , '' she snapped , facing the other guys and then meeting noah 's eyes .	1
`` i think you 're a little confused about my noah here . ''	1
she pulled him closer , feeling the hot flush of her friend 's face .	1
`` he 's with me . ''	1
noah 's face was just inches from hers .	1
she kissed him , and maybe it was the shock , but noah did n't pull away .	1
then she broke away and looked rudolph right in the eye .	1
`` no boyfriend-stealing tonight .	1
ok ? ''	1
silence dropped around the bar like chloroform , and then tiago cleared his throat , cheeks splotched maroon .	1
`` oh , man .	1
this is really awkward .	1
we 're , uh , really sorry .	1
did n't know you , uh ? were with her . ''	1
tiago let his eyes shoot to wara , who slid away from noah 's body onto one of his knees and was eyeing the guys with one eyebrow raised .	1
`` yeah . ''	1
rudolf had stood and was apologizing .	1
`` i just thought , i mean , you knew we were gay and you were so nice to us and no one ever is so ? ''	1
`` yeah , man , '' tiago rushed on .	1
`` i did n't know why you were always talking to us and stuff .	1
everyone else that is n't ... you know ? always treats us like trash . ''	1
tiago swore and took a deep breath , smiling nervously .	1
`` anyway , i 'm sure you wo n't want to hang out with us anymore . ''	1
noah unexpectedly burst into laugher and ran his fingers through his hair .	1
`` you know what guys ? ''	1
he said .	1
`` it can happen to anyone .	1
we all make ? assumptions sometimes .	1
and i 'll see you around .	1
just so you know not to try to , you know , hook me up .	1
someday , if it 's all over ? ''	1
noah jerked his chin over wara 's way , `` i 'll let you know so you can introduce me to any eligible sisters you may have .	1
c'mon , i think it 's time for us to be going for today , '' noah announced to wara , a little too loudly .	1
he threw tiago and company one last red-faced smile and headed for the door .	1
noah remembered to hold the door open for her , and then they began a brisk walk towards the closest major street .	1
it was obvious that neither of them felt like going back into caf amara .	1
the cool night air hit wara full in the face and the fire rose from her belly to scald her cheeks as she realized what she had done .	1
did i actually just kiss noah ?	1
she had , and in front of witnesses .	1
oh god , i ca n't believe this !	1
noah was quiet for nearly a block , and wara nearly suffocated with shame .	1
i am the worst missionary in the world !	1
what if the mission heard about this ?	1
just one more thing to add to her list of awful indiscretions .	1
then she heard a soft chuckle .	1
she jerked her head around to look at him , still not quite meeting his eye .	1
the cobblestones shimmered a little in front of her , and wara was starting to feel a little queasy .	1
`` well , wara , that was a little unconventional , '' noah nodded , `` but you really saved me there .	1
i do n't know what else to say , so i 'll just say , 'thank you . ' ''	1
`` that was really dumb , '' wara mumbled .	1
`` i should never drink .	1
i never learn . ''	1
noah was silent a minute more , and then he put a hand on wara 's shoulder .	1
`` can we sit down here for a sec ? ''	1
he asked evenly .	1
`` sure , fine , '' she answered too hurriedly .	1
she plopped down on a bench in the plaza they had been passing through , in the shadow of a darkened colonial cathedral that was hidden away in the heart of downtown .	1
she crossed her arms tightly across her chest and waited to hear whatever noah had to say .	1
this was n't going to be pretty .	1
the quiet continued as noah sat down a comfortable distance away on the bench , and stared off towards the stone pillars at the plaza 's center .	1
finally he spoke .	1
`` so , that was my first kiss . ''	1
wara jolted .	1
she could n't help glancing over at him to see if he was serious .	1
the way his lashes were lowered , that twist of his lips ? wara suddenly realized she knew noah too well .	1
he was serious .	1
memories flooded her heart , unwelcome , and she swatted them away in anger .	1
it was n't fair !	1
ok , yes it was .	1
it was no one 's fault but her own .	1
but sitting here watching noah , she could tell that he still cared for her as a friend , even though she 'd totally humiliated herself .	1
and she felt just destroyed .	1
even if she really loved him , noah would never , ever , be able to be with someone like her , not with her past and his ? his first kiss ?	1
`` look , this was a huge mistake , '' wara groaned out loud .	1
`` i just felt bad and wanted to help you ? and i did n't think . ''	1
oh yeah , and i 'm drunk , she thought angrily .	1
`` i think i should go home and you should go ? back to the coffee shop .	1
and just please , do n't tell anybody . ''	1
as if he would .	1
wara felt the slow burn spread across the bridge of her nose .	1
what a disaster !	1
`` i wo n't tell anyone , '' noah promised her .	1
`` and really , while tonight has been a little ? weird , i think it worked really well to save me from rudolf .	1
i do n't know what i would have done without you . ''	1
wara sighed and blew her bangs out of her eye as she stood up , tottering unsteadily .	1
`` hey , wait a sec . ''	1
noah frowned at her .	1
`` i 'm not letting you go home by yourself !	1
you , my dear , are totally wasted . ''	1
he stood up and held out his arms to steady her , just as nausea surged and the night began to spin around in circles .	1
`` i 'll take you home , send the guys a text that they can sing without me .	1
and do n't worry , '' he said seriously , kindly .	1
`` i wo n't tell anyone .	1
4 mocha after deciding how franco salazar would die , alejo 's team took the rest of the day off .	1
alejo spent most of the time wandering the crooked lanes of the peshawar bazaar , staring at gold jewelry to die for and reams of cloth embroidered with a river of color .	1
if he were gabriel and in love with a girl with amazing sapphire eyes , would he buy her that one gold necklace with wreaths of fairy-tale leaves and bottomless blue stones ?	1
alejo blinked at the shop window , realizing he had no idea what he would do .	1
during high school back in bolivia , the girls were more interested in his whiter , richer friends .	1
since then he 'd been too busy trying to save the world .	1
stalin found him sweltering under the sun in front of the jewelry shop , clapped him on the shoulder and steered him towards a coffee shop , one of the few modern one in this city .	1
`` do n't tell me , i can already see it in your eyes , '' stalin said when they 'd taken a seat on the sleek red benches .	1
`` you 've been reading that book again .	1
and that means questions , big life and death questions .	1
go ahead .	1
ask them all .	1
i am an expert on the document in question , after all . ''	1
alejo glanced behind them , checking that they were still alone here in the corner .	1
a young couple sat at the opposite extreme of the coffee shop , he wearing jeans and she a short white kameez top , wide-bottom black pants , and a leopard print veil .	1
they both giggled at each other and sipped something fruity from glasses with paper-maiche umbrellas .	1
the drinks stalin had ordered for them arrived , something with a ridiculous amount of whipped cream and caramel on top .	1
`` does this even have coffee ? ''	1
alejo frowned at the stuff suspiciously .	1
`` you do n't like caramel mochas ? ''	1
stalin grinned .	1
whatever .	1
could n't be worse than that luke-warm fermented mare 's milk he 'd choked down on assignment in uzbekistan a few years ago .	1
`` i do n't think i do have more questions , '' alejo narrowed his eyes at stalin .	1
`` and that 's the scary part .	1
we both know you love to be right , and i 'm giving this one to you .	1
your arguments convinced me : the texts are authentic .	1
he really said it .	1
and if i believe that , i ca n't be muslim anymore . ''	1
alejo felt his brow lower saying it out loud .	1
stalin swore under his breath across the table .	1
`` you seriously believe it ? ''	1
a bead of sweat popped out of his forehead and he slurped caramel and cream .	1
`` this time , i 'm not sure if i should have allowed my extreme intellect to be so convincing . ''	1
`` i do , '' alejo crossed his legs and leaned back .	1
`` i ca n't help it , i just do .	1
i believe jesus is the son of god . ''	1
`` and that means you ca n't be a muslim anymore , '' stalin conceded glumly .	1
`` it 's just not possible .	1
allah has no son .	1
if gabriel finds out , he 's going to have a cow . ''	1
yeah , gabriel was really religious , more than anyone else on alejo 's team .	1
but the one alejo really dreaded telling was ishmael khan .	1
the khan loved alejo like a son , and in the pashto culture that kind of love should never be broken .	1
he was going to take it hard that alejo had to leave islam ? and the prism , besides .	1
`` but it 's just not right for me to stay where i am , '' alejo told stalin , `` if i 'm not a muslim .	1
i 'll have to tell them . ''	1
alejo felt relieved it was all decided .	1
but stalin 's eyes had gone all buggy behind his tiny round glasses .	1
he chewed on one chapped lip and stirred the mess of coffee and cream left in his cup with the straw .	1
`` alejo , i do n't think you can just tell them , '' he said worriedly .	1
stalin licked a film of whipped cream off his upper lip and sighed .	1
`` do n't you remember what happened to marco ? ''	1
marco , until a year ago , was the prism leader for colombia and venezuela .	1
the poor guy was murdered in a horrible break-in , along with his sister and some young nieces ; the whole thing had been really hard for alejo and his team .	1
stalin was watching the memory cross alejo 's face and he nodded grimly .	1
`` it happened right after he retired .	1
did n't it ?	1
i mean , alejo , you are the best of us , always busy exercising , studying other languages .	1
but the lazier of us have time to sit around and listen to rumors .	1
marco leaves the prism to take up agriculture .	1
or pottery .	1
or something , i do n't know .	1
then weeks later , he 's murdered , along with his entire family .	1
the scary thing is , the 964 did n't seem the least bit surprised . ''	1
the 964 was the group of incredibly wealthy people who financed the prism .	1
and why would n't the 964 be surprised ?	1
because they were behind the whole thing , that 's why .	1
frost crept into alejo 's veins as it all came together .	1
the picture shoved under the door of his house in bolivia , a bunch of little kids arriving home from school in uniforms and overstuffed backpacks .	1
a house number clearly visible over the door .	1
stalin had also gotten a really weird picture of his parents wearing matching lime green t-shirts at a rally for world peace .	1
alejo had been so obsessed with salazar he 'd paid no attention to the prism funders ' reaction to marco 's death .	1
he 'd felt the surprise at seeing that picture show up but never figured out the hint .	1
`` they 're telling us they know where our families are , '' he stated the obvious .	1
alejo 's tone turned bitter .	1
`` if we leave , people we care about die . ''	1
four o'clock came early the next morning , when the khan came to pick him up for the trip to the countryside tribal area .	1
a sleek black hummer glided to a stop in front of the apartment , purring in the early morning chill .	1
a man in a shalwar kameez that was cotton candy pink held the hummer 's rear door for alejo : mateen , an employee of the khan that a guy would be wise not to mess with , despite the pink clothes .	1
mateen nodded wordlessly at alejo and deferentially closed the hummer door behind him .	1
the leather seats were freezing .	1
alejo crossed his arms across his chest and greeted two of the khan 's burly body guards , wearing the round woolen caps that were traditional pashto garb .	1
each held a well-cared for automatic weapon very comfortably between their knees .	1
`` asalaam aleikum , '' they grinned back at him over thick , unkempt beards .	1
`` ishmael , '' alejo nodded at his boss , who , eerily , was impeccably dressed even at this ungodly hour of the morning .	1
ishmael khan was a philanthropist , giving away a lot of his wealth to build hospitals and schools here in pakistan as well as in bolivia .	1
the broken hand of two-year old jamila was what ishmael khan fought for .	1
this was what alejo 's handler saw every time he heard about another child killed by the americans in afghanistan : the tiny , coffee-colored hand of his niece , protruding from the rubble of her home in the mountains .	1
she 'd been crushed by a stray american missile back in 2008 , massacred in the same day as her five siblings .	1
the americans had apologized .	1
the khan had n't accepted .	1
now ishmael khan was alejo 's handler in the prism , this muslim organization dedicated to fighting against injustice for allah .	1
alejo was the prism leader for all of south america , excluding colombia and venezuela , where marco 's replacement now worked .	1
the chill from his conversation with stalin yesterday still sat in alejo 's bones .	1
the khan was a strict muslim , but would he really react so strongly to alejo 's moving on as stalin had implied ?	1
maybe only the 964 really cared , because they were the ones who invested all the money in training alejo .	1
or maybe stalin and alejo were just painting themselves scary pictures from nothing , like campfire ghost stories under the moon .	1
gabriel cleared his throat from the third row of seats behind alejo .	1
the rest of alejo 's team had stayed behind in peshawar .	1
`` i thought we might have to drag your butt out of bed , '' he chuckled .	1
`` for the first time ever .	1
you were looking pretty down yesterday . ''	1
alejo was irritated .	1
they did n't know why he personally hated salazar so much .	1
to them he was just another scumbag who was about to be offed .	1
and , except for stalin , they absolutely did n't know a thing about the decision alejo was trying to make .	1
the roads outside of peshawar were cut into dry , dusty mountain faces , and incredibly sheer drop-offs framed their narrow edges .	1
eventually the hummer left the peaks and jolted across a stony field where the rutted tracks were barely visible in the weak light of dawn .	1
everywhere , mud-brick houses sprung up out of the rocky dust ; most were shattered from missiles , empty shells of the family life that must once have filled them .	1
small children sometimes lined the road , staring with huge , kohl-lined eyes as the impressive hummer roared past , clouding their ragged bodies in billows of thick dust .	1
sometime around noon , the armored hummer arrived at a run-down village , consisting of a cluster of houses around a stone well .	1
mangy , skeletal donkeys wandered about , tethered to fraying ropes .	1
scrawny chickens had free range of the dusty central courtyard .	1
a baby cried franticly from inside one of the single-room homes .	1
a piece of burlap hung over the small window stirred , a dark form peered out , and the baby was immediately hushed .	1
somewhere in the near distance , the dull echo of a missile launcher pounded against the surrounding mountains .	1
alejo started , and realized they were near the current battle zone .	1
with a cool hiss , the metallic doors of the hummer unlocked and opened .	1
mateen took a long drink from a two-liter bottle of luke-warm coca-cola .	1
the pashtun guards leapt out of the car , weapons gripped tightly in their rough hands .	1
`` settle down , settle down , '' the khan barked in pashto , appearing amused .	1
`` there 's nothing to be afraid of right here , in this village .	1
it 's still ours .	1
our commander is in constant contact with me , by sat phone . ''	1
ishmael patted the pocket of his gray wool jacket from a posh london shop .	1
`` you all stay here and guard the car , '' ishmael instructed his guards and driver .	1
`` keeping a sharp eye out towards us , of course , as a precaution . ''	1
the khan cleared his throat , spit a wad of hashish on the ground and turned towards alejo , all smiles .	1
`` and as for you , your hour has come .	1
did i not tell you i had a surprise for you ?	1
forgot to mention it , eh ?	1
well , i have a little something i want to show you , and i think you will be very surprised .	1
pleasantly . ''	1
alejo hid his displeasure behind a passive mask .	1
yeah , he was surprised .	1
what could be here , so near the battle zone , that the khan wanted him to see ?	1
there was nothing here but run-down huts .	1
and people who needed help .	1
`` come on , alejo , '' the khan was saying , heading towards a larger , low-slung mud building that was on the close side of the courtyard .	1
alejo 's leather sandals sucked at the mud as he followed ishmael .	1
a thin plume of smoke snaked from the chimney of the building into the slate gray of the sky .	1
alejo halted impatiently outside the splintered wooden door as the khan called into the building in pashto , a curt answer came back to him , and the khan motioned happily for alejo to open the door .	1
features impassive , alejo pushed his way cautiously into the darkened building and found , more or less , what he had expected : a room tightly packed with mud-caked , exhausted mujahedeen , taking an early-morning snooze by the fire before heading out to fight the enemy combatants .	1
most wore grimy shalwar kameezs and the traditional pashtun hats , with a ring around the bottom , bulging like a wool muffin on the top .	1
the men looked thin and under-fed and much too young to be here .	1
many had body parts wrapped up in dirt-encrusted , ratty bandages mottled with dried blood .	1
around one hundred pairs of brown , battle-weary eyes stared back at alejo as his vision adjusted to the dim lighting .	1
he felt the khan push past him , forcing him further inside the room .	1
`` well , come see your surprise ! ''	1
alejo was confused , but did n't let it show , only cocking an eyebrow at ishmael .	1
he was n't interested in radical fighters and all their petty battles over slight differences in religion or generational blood feuds .	1
what was he doing here ?	1
`` asalaam alaikum ! ''	1
ishmael greeted the men enthusiastically , and they , obviously knowing who he was , made an effort to sit up straighter with respect and returned the pashto greeting .	1
`` this is the man i told you about , the man i told your commander i would bring to you . ''	1
the khan motioned widely towards alejo , as pleased as a kindergartner presenting his newest coloring page to his favorite teacher .	1
`` please greet our visitor . ''	1
alejo was perplexed to see grins spreading across the chapped faces of many of the men in the room .	1
an unexplained feeling of dread crept across his chest as he watched them .	1
and then the men opened their mouths and spoke .	1
5 aquamarine pakistan if gabriel shara were any happier , he might just die .	1
it had happened .	1
his dream had finally come true !	1
he .	1
was .	1
going to marry .	1
ambrin ! ! !	1
gabriel had never thought it would all happen so soon .	1
but while alejo was chatting with the mujahedeen warriors in that town with the mangy donkey , ishmael khan had pulled gabriel aside and said the best words of the century : `` gabriel my son , i 've heard you have noticed my niece . ''	1
it was all going to be arranged , next year when ambrin finished nursing school .	1
and though marrying ambrin was about the most awesome news gabriel could imagine , the khan had n't been finished .	1
there was a client , a super-important client , hiring for a super-important mission .	1
and the khan wanted gabriel to take the job !	1
`` you 're the one , gabriel shara , '' ishmael had smiled warmly outside under the blazing pakistani sun .	1
`` think about it and let me know . ''	1
but gabriel did n't need to think about it .	1
he 'd pretend to for a few days , just to negotiate the price a little .	1
but why should he even do that ?	1
this mission was a dream come true , a gigantic victory in the cause of justice .	1
for goodness sakes , he should just do it for free !	1
gabriel 's brain was doing cartwheels by the time they stopped for a bite to eat in a one-horse town along the road back to peshawar .	1
absolutely everyone along the village 's single road stopped to gawk as mateen pulled the black hummer over next to a ditch of raw sewage , then ducked after the khan into the village 's only eating establishment .	1
the bodyguards were talking loudly about some tv show , but alejo was lost in a world of his own , ever since they had left the tribal area .	1
he got like that sometimes .	1
gabriel had found if you just left him alone , he would come out of the funk before you knew it .	1
he tried to catch alejo 's eye with a smile as they entered the restaurant .	1
grimy aquamarine walls dominated the small eating place with their shocking color , and cheap plastic mats spread across the floor .	1
several groups of men were already eating their lunch , one leg folded up to support their right arm , the other bent cross-legged on the woven mat .	1
with their right hand , the pashtun men scooped up cooked spinach with torn pieces of oven-roasted naan bread .	1
along one wall lay a scattered pile of black plastic sandals in varying states of muddiness .	1
several of the men 's blackened , bare feet twitched only a few inches away from the food .	1
bon apetit .	1
before digging in , gabriel slipped his cell phone out of one pocket to check the time .	1
yep .	1
time for prayers .	1
around twenty other men in the room began to unroll tattered prayer mats from a special corner of the restaurant , working as one man to spread them out in rows in the middle of the uneven concrete floor , facing mecca .	1
the town 's mosque must have been very near by , judging by the volume of the haunting call to prayer that suddenly cut through the air over a loudspeaker .	1
the customers who were already here for lunch would simply pray together here .	1
a small spigot of water just outside the door in a concrete courtyard provided a place for the men to perform wudu , ritual washing for prayers .	1
gabriel waited his turn at the trickle of water and began to focus his mind on allah as he washed all the parts required by the prophet .	1
alejo took gabriel 's place at the faucet and began washing , quiet and morose .	1
gabriel 's bare , wet feet made a sucking sound as he padded back inside across the now muddy concrete , his large , moist footprints mingling with the others to create a mosaic of darkened patches on the restaurant floor .	1
frigid rivulets of water formed crystal drops like sweat down gabriel 's face , from his wet , spiky hair to his chin .	1
kneeling down next to alejo , gabriel prostrated himself on his mat and began to pray to the one who , alone , could reward him with eternal life .	1
he had to wait another week , but gabriel finally got some time off .	1
the rest of his team had flown back to bolivia the day after that legendary trip to the tribal area , the one where gabriel 's dreams of ambrin began to come true .	1
since then , gabriel had been back , training a new group of recruits in the tribal area .	1
he knew how to make stuff : molotov cocktails , pretty good bombs , electronic bugs for picking up conversations .	1
and he was a really good sniper .	1
he 'd had to learn this stuff when hezbollah trained him in iran , along with alejo , benjamin , stalin , and a bunch of other guys .	1
he 'd gotten a scholarship in bolivia to go to university in iran , and been recruited into the prism there .	1
the training had been excellent .	1
and now gabriel was just passing it all on .	1
hard work , but today i get a reminder that in the end it all pays off .	1
literally .	1
sitting in the middle of one of the khan 's gilded apartments , gabriel flushed , glancing at the fat pile of cash gripped tightly in his hand .	1
his salary for the next few months .	1
gabriel , it 's not about the money !	1
he scolded himself .	1
it was all about doing what allah wanted .	1
a knock thudded against the apartment door , and gabriel opened to find ishmael 's employee mateen .	1
the huge pashtun guard was clad in a cotton candy pink shalwar kameez , but the muscles bulging under mateen 's shirt convinced gabriel that the color somehow did n't make the man look any less respectable .	1
`` mr. khan sent me to tell you i will pick you up at eight for a little good-bye dinner , '' mateen announced .	1
a smile twitched above mateen 's bushy black beard and he bowed deferentially , then glided back towards the silver bmw idling outside the door .	1
you mean at ten , gabriel raised an eyebrow at the departing guard .	1
people accused bolivians of always being tardy to everything , but really , they had no idea .	1
pakistanis had them beat .	1
seeing the beard reminded gabriel of his own pathetic attempt to grow a beard in order to be a good muslim .	1
the few inches of reddish , peachy fuzz dusting his chin at least showed that he had made the effort to be pious .	1
i will never be able to wear a pink shalwar kameez like mateen , gabriel thought .	1
the door to the apartment pounded shut , and he sighed as he was left alone .	1
a shiny , distorted image of himself glimmered back at him from a mirror in the golden wardrobe on the opposite wall , and gabriel scowled at his measly beard pack .	1
i 've got to pack .	1
them maybe i can settle down and watch a sermon from one of the mullahs on tv .	1
his trusty hiker backpack was propped up next to the bed , and gabriel opened the huge gold wardrobe and pulled out a stack of folded shalwar kameezs , sweaters and jeans .	1
now , on to his babies .	1
first , he carefully lifted his favorite quran , inside its black leather quran case , from its position of respect on the highest table in the room and gently placed it inside the backpack .	1
then came the hard shelled black case from under the bed .	1
gabriel fondly clicked the case open , revealing the smooth , honey wood of his violin .	1
this guy had been with him since his parents had given it to him for his sixteenth birthday , and the violin always came with gabriel to anywhere he went that was important .	1
he carefully placed the small case inside his backpack .	1
there .	1
now that the violin is here , wherever we go i 'll be home .	1
that left the money .	1
he understood the reasons , but sometimes really wished his boss did n't have to pay him in cash .	1
debit cards existed for a reason , did n't they ?	1
gabriel decided to deposit all this cash in the bank , one of the many banks close to the apartment where he had an account .	1
he pulled a fraying gray sweater over his long shalwar kameez and headed to the bank .	1
thirty minutes later , having disposed of the cash , gabriel strolled lazily down one of peshawar 's main thoroughfares under a thick haze of ochre smog and pollution .	1
bordering the sidewalk , heavy buses painted like kaleidoscopes rumbled by next to wooden donkey carts .	1
a chorus of a thousand horns blared .	1
two female shapes , heavily-shrouded in black veils that fell to the ground , glided in front of gabriel and began to weave their way across the street .	1
though modestly covered , the girls ' huge dark eyes were exposed and gabriel could tell they must be young , maybe about his age .	1
then he realized what he was thinking , and his face began a slow burn .	1
he was ashamed for even noticing them .	1
oh allah , help me !	1
here i 've been offered this great mission , and i 'm so unworthy .	1
you 've got to make me pure and clean .	1
please !	1
still praying , he ducked past a street vendor and a sizzling vat of curry into a winding alleyway , already shadowy in the approaching night .	1
a crunching sensation of angst in his belly came at the same moment as gabriel 's eyes told him he had erred and let his mind wander away from his surroundings .	1
he barely registered the shadowy shapes of three men who had suddenly surged from behind into his peripheral vision , then came the flash of adrenaline .	1
the force of their bodies propelled gabriel face first against the coarse concrete wall .	1
feeling true panic , gabriel swore in spanish .	1
two of the men gripped his arms tightly behind his back , while the third tore off gabriel 's cap , threw it on the ground , and grabbed his hair so that he could not turn his face toward either side .	1
`` what are you doing ? ''	1
gabriel gasped in pashto .	1
maybe they had mistaken him for someone else .	1
with his light skin , he did look a lot like an afghani .	1
`` shut up !	1
if you look at us , you 'll die ! ''	1
yelled one of the men in a voice that sounded like a traffic accident .	1
they yanked gabriel 's head back by the hair , exposing his neck and scraping his nose and chin painfully across the pock-marked wall .	1
and then he felt the prick of a very wicked knife pressed against his throat .	1
`` i-i 'm not looking ! ''	1
gabriel stammered , hating himself for not being able to control the tremor .	1
if i were alejo i would fight these guys ?	1
something hot and tangy oozed off gabriel 's bloodied lip onto his tongue .	1
the taste of his own blood made him want to gag .	1
`` give us all the money you got from the bank . ''	1
the demand came from one of the men , shadowy in the darkness of the back alley-way .	1
`` or we 'll cut your throat , dirty afghan . ''	1
gabriel swallowed hard and took a steadying breath .	1
`` of course .	1
i have the money right here in my pocket .	1
the left one .	1
all my money is there , in my wallet . ''	1
a hand thrust violently into the left pocket of gabriel 's long kameez , causing him to totter and the knife at his neck to bite into his flesh .	1
gabriel gasped and told the men , `` but i did n't get any money at the bank .	1
i went there to deposit . ''	1
`` you filthy liar ! ''	1
one of them yelled , twisting gabriel 's arm so hard behind his back that his eyes watered from the pain .	1
`` we saw you go into the bank .	1
if you 're hiding the money , we 'll slaughter you like a pig . ''	1
they had followed him from the bank !	1
how had he not noticed ?	1
you 've been a fool , gabriel .	1
a fool .	1
how could you get so lost in your thoughts ?	1
`` but ? look in my wallet .	1
you 'll see . ''	1
gabriel swallowed hard , felt his adam 's apple rub raw across the concrete wall .	1
`` there 's the deposit receipt there .	1
you can see that i left a deposit there in the bank .	1
all the money i have now is there in my wallet . ''	1
sweat ran down gabriel 's face , along with the blood .	1
he knew that there were only around two hundred rupees in his wallet , a paltry sum , enough to buy some potato chips and a coke .	1
thank god he had nothing in his wallet to identify him as a westerner , as usual .	1
there was only his afghan identity card , thanks to the khans .	1
a snarl and several pashto curses told gabriel that , indeed , the thieves were not pleased with the pittance in his wallet or the rumpled slip that told them twenty thousand euros had been deposited before their victim left the bank and they began to follow him .	1
the man holding the blade at gabriel 's throat swore violently in his ear .	1
`` hold him ! ''	1
rough hands dug into his upper arms .	1
someone else pulled on his hair , forcing gabriel 's face towards the sky .	1
the knife slashed his throat like the sting of a thousand wasps and his eyes rolled back into his head .	1
everything hazed over midnight , and the world was black before gabriel shara even crumpled at the thieves ' feet next to the graffiti-covered wall .	1
it was terribly strange to be aware that the world was passing by around you , but yet to feel yourself immobile as a stone , limbs heavy as petrified wood .	1
drifting in and out of awareness , gabriel finally reached a point of realizing that he could move his lips and try to speak , and what he tried to say was , `` help . ''	1
he was in a dirty room filled with ivs , a few cots , and a chess board on a little table , pieces paused mid-game .	1
the ivs mean doctors , a hospital .	1
what 's with the chess game ?	1
i 'm not dead .	1
gabriel felt his heart beat slow and cold .	1
this could n't possibly be some kind of freaky afterlife filled with rusting metal cots and eternal games of chess ?	1
am i dead ?	1
gabriel attempted to roll over to one side , morbid curiosity winning out over sluggishness .	1
something stabbed through his neck and chest with the movement , and he yelled , suddenly remembering the alley and the thieves and the knife slitting his throat .	1
and then he saw alejo , materializing in this strange room , followed by a short little doctor in a dirty lab coat .	1
`` take it easy , gabo , '' alejo said hoarsely .	1
`` do n't move .	1
you 're safe now . ''	1
gabriel forced himself to relax back into the pillow , weak with relief at the sight of his friend .	1
was alejo looking about to cry ?	1
over him ?	1
`` they had to sew you up pretty quickly , '' alejo said , then cleared his throat .	1
`` someone found you .	1
in the alley .	1
they did n't cut your windpipe .	1
do you remember what happened ? ''	1
if he held really still , the pain of talking was manageable .	1
`` yes .	1
they wanted ? money . ''	1
the doctor had moved to the side of the bed and was checking stitches on gabriel 's neck .	1
stitches he really did n't even want to imagine .	1
`` you must realize , my friend , how lucky you are , '' the short doctor clucked at gabriel .	1
`` it is truly a miracle you are still here .	1
and you have such a good friend , this man who flew here all the way from the americas when he heard what happened . ''	1
alejo was crying .	1
he was trying to pretend it was just a piece of dust he had to scrub from one eye , but the ruse was n't working very well .	1
gabriel felt his face spread into a grin .	1
a very sad-looking , lopsided grin , but a happy one nonetheless .	1
`` allah has chosen you , my friend , '' the doctor patted gabriel on the shoulder .	1
`` you must never forget it .	1
your life belongs to him now . ''	1
that was supposed to be comforting , was n't it ?	1
but gabriel felt the smile drain from his lips .	1
what if he messed up ?	1
allah had saved him by a miracle .	1
and gabriel knew how it worked .	1
now he had to pay allah back .	1
6 emerald coroico , bolivia wara shifted positions against the worn gray upholstery of the minibus , managing to win an extra half-inch or so for her left leg .	1
she hooked one dusty converse tennis shoe through the straps of her purple backpack , a habit she had developed to be able to drift off to sleep while traveling without the possibility of someone sneaking off with her bag .	1
nazaret was fast asleep next to her , blond curls plastered to wara 's shoulder .	1
on wara 's other side , through the window , soaring peaks of emerald contrasted with sheer drop-offs , mere inches from the edge of the dirt-caked road .	1
nazaret and wara were on their way to coroico , sleepy tropical tourist town in the mountains , for a four-day weekend vacation .	1
this was the first time pastor martir had let his daughter go away for so long , even though nazaret was the same age as wara , twenty-seven .	1
latino fathers tended to be extra-protective of their daughters , more so than american dads .	1
the bennesons from wara 's mission had let her take some time off from helping at the aids center , and her literacy classes for quechua women were only twice a week anyway .	1
as the distance between wara and cochabamba grew , she allowed herself to think of that disastrous night she 'd been trying to forget for the past month : the electric blue glow of caf paris , several drinks too many , kissing noah next to the bar .	1
even now , wara felt her cheeks flame at the memory of that really ill-advised kiss .	1
in the plaza outside the caf that night , while still feeling the effects of the alcohol , wara had felt crushed with the realization that noah would never be able to love her .	1
a dilemma that never would have bothered her before .	1
but since sobering up , wara found that her feelings of dismay over the situation with noah had n't changed .	1
of course , she felt ridiculous for having embarrassed herself in front of him .	1
but it was more than that .	1
that night she had seen how noah still looked at her with kindness after that stupid moment in the bar .	1
she knew , now , that she really did love him .	1
at least it felt that way .	1
wara closed her eyes against the smooth glass , heart sinking all the way down to her toes .	1
but he could never love me .	1
a jolt from underneath the minibus began at the flimsy metal seat and rode up wara 's spine , rattling her cheek against the glass .	1
she opened her eyes and felt the bus brake solidly , pebbles exploding along the pavement .	1
the rear end of the vehicle fishtailed towards the sheer cliff at the edge of the road .	1
soft shrieks and muted curses rose from the other bus passengers , and wara 's heart flew to her throat as nazaret jerked wide awake .	1
a skidding bus anywhere near the edge of this mountain road was ample cause for alarm .	1
the road that led down from la paz to coroico was no ordinary road ; it was booked in most tour guides as the road of death , the most dangerous road in the world .	1
cut at unbelievable angles into the emerald heart of the andes , the road boasted drop-offs of 1800 feet at some points .	1
nazaret gasped loudly at wara 's side , clutching her little rolling suitcase covered in pink poodles and eiffel towers .	1
then the minibus drew to a halt , engulfed in a fine mist of pewter-colored dirt .	1
they were still on the road , but wara 's knees were shaking .	1
five seconds later , the dust glided away , leaving the bus passengers a view of metal debris and a gutted , blown-out tire splayed over the pavement .	1
`` a bus went over the mountain ! ''	1
a man called from a few rows back .	1
wara took a deep breath and knit her shaking fingers together in her lap .	1
a plump quechua woman on the other side of nazaret answered loudly , `` it 's the accident from two days ago .	1
the one from the news . ''	1
old accident or not , the bus passengers were curious .	1
the door of the minivan slid open with a hollow whine and everyone spilled out , cautiously tiptoeing over to the cliff .	1
a humid breeze whipped at their hair from across the ravine and the sunshine seared their shoulders .	1
`` the road of death , living up to its name , '' a woman muttered .	1
a chorus of gasps rose upon viewing what was once a large , sleek tour bus , belly up in a tangle of trees a thousand feet below .	1
horrified , wara could make out the tiny stick forms of what appeared to be bodies sprawled on the way down to the crash .	1
`` good heavens , '' an elderly man stammered .	1
`` they 're just going to leave them here ? ''	1
`` the rescue teams have been working since the accident , '' replied a skinny kid in a hoodie .	1
`` they find the survivors first , then bring up the bodies .	1
they 'll probably be back tomorrow .	1
it 's getting late . ''	1
as wara stared wide-eyed down the precipice , the magnitude of rappelling down that sheer cliff to attempt a rescue effort hit her .	1
her head spun and she backed away , hurrying to the minibus where the driver was ordering them all to return .	1
nazaret never made it back to sleep during the remaining hour ride to coroico , and wara did her best to focus on the primitive beauty of the living mountains and not the valley below .	1
the first tinges of dusk were just beginning to paint the expanse over the mountains when coroico came into view , all coral-tiled roofs jutting out over an emerald mass of vegetation , like a man riding a foaming wave into the thin air over a precipice that dropped into the valley below .	1
the bus followed winding roads and soon arrived at coroico 's main plaza , a square affair surrounded by touristy restaurants and tour guide offices .	1
the rubber wheels of nazaret 's suitcase bounced over cobblestones as she and wara walked towards their hotel .	1
the hotel bella vista was four blocks from the plaza , and wara sagged with relief as she entered its cream-colored hall and spotless wood parquet floor .	1
a beautiful brick fountain gurgled in the atrium , splashing water across smooth pebbles .	1
`` it 's good to be back , '' she muttered , heading towards the room she always reserved at the back of the hotel .	1
it was really good to be anywhere , after seeing the fate of that bus down in the valley .	1
inside the room she and nazaret had reserved , a giant plate-glass window was framed by crimson and gold curtains .	1
though the sun had sunk a little more behind the mountains , the amazing spread of the valley below was still visible in muted tones , proving why this hotel was called the beautiful view .	1
beyond the crimson curtains , tangled tropical life stretched out far below them as far as the eye could see , blanketing the soaring mountains in emerald array .	1
a winding river cut through the middle of the valley , and wet salmon-colored clouds clung to the tops of the mountains that were still lower than the town of coroico .	1
wara and nazaret fell asleep right after dinner from a tiny pizza restaurant , and did n't move again til morning .	1
she and nazaret spent the next day exploring the tiny tourist town : horseback riding over the emerald mountains , lunch at the little german caf , then a walk over towards casa bonita for homemade organic ice cream .	1
crashing for a while in coroico 's main plaza under the stars seemed to be the perfect ending .	1
wara and nazaret collapsed on a bench and stretched their legs out next to a tinkling stone fountain .	1
groups of fair-skinned tourists , wearing khaki shorts with hiking sandals and socks , sat around the plaza laughing too loudly and munching pringles and snickers bars that the local stores kept on hand for the healthy flow of foreigners brought to their town by the adventure tourism industry .	1
a young bolivian couple strolled by with their son and a pair of mickey mouse balloons , munching hamburgers wrapped in plastic sacks .	1
and near the tinkling fountain , a group of women in dark islamic robes stood quietly , passing out pieces of paper to anyone interested .	1
`` looks like islam is growing here , too . ''	1
nazaret had also noticed the muslim girls , trying to share their faith here in coroico with people passing by .	1
`` not just in the big cities .	1
next year they finish that huge mosque in cochabamba , you know . ''	1
wara did know that ; during the last decade , bolivia and iran had become close friends .	1
with more muslims coming to bolivia for business or study , some bolivians were converting to islam .	1
and the iranians had built many hospitals and schools in needy parts of the country .	1
there was probably one here outside of coroico .	1
`` boo ! ''	1
wara nearly jumped out of her skin as two rough hands covered her eyes , blinding her .	1
she panicked and tried to lean forward but could n't break away .	1
she felt a body come over the back of her bench into the space between her and nazaret as the hands disappeared .	1
annoyed , wara realized that the bony shoulder pressing into hers belonged to tobin , the wiry , blond australian friend of noah 's .	1
`` tobin ! ''	1
wara scolded .	1
`` what ? ?	1
you really freaked me out ! ''	1
she paused , frowning , wondering what tobin was doing here .	1
wara leaned around tobin and saw that eduardo sejas , the good-looking bolivian who sang with noah at the cafe , was sitting on the edge of the bench next to nazaret , wearing cargo pants , a dirty t-shirt , and a heavy-duty backpack .	1
nazaret 's lips were turned up into a smile , and wara followed her gaze to see tobias , the other australian , and noah .	1
standing in front of her bench , smiling down at her .	1
wara gulped .	1
and paled .	1
what were they doing here ?	1
`` aww , we 're sorry we scared you guys ! ''	1
a quick glance over at eduardo showed white teeth flashing against his tan jaw .	1
`` we did n't know it would freak you out . ''	1
he paused and waved his hand as if to erase the past .	1
`` so , hello !	1
nice to see you ! ''	1
tobin kissed a still-frozen wara on the cheek , and the other guys leaned in to give greetings .	1
noah was wearing khaki shorts with leather hiking sandals , and his tanned legs were covered in powdery dirt .	1
a t-shirt with cut-off sleeves left the tattoo of blue celtic symbols around his upper arm clearly visible .	1
wara dared to meet his eyes and saw no sign that he was thinking of the last time they 'd hung out , in caf paris .	1
noah leaned forward to give her a bolivian cheek-smooch , and wara felt her face go hot .	1
`` what are you guys doing here ? ''	1
she asked much too sharply .	1
how could we have ended up coming to the same place for weekends away ?	1
i never heard noah or any of the guys talking about this !	1
well , she had also been avoiding him .	1
`` well , '' tobin said cheerfully in his lovely accent , `` we 've been planning this for quite a while , right guys ?	1
today and tomorrow we are doing 'adventure tourism ' here around coroico , and then monday we are heading out for the hike to the cotapata nature reserve .	1
what is it , eduardo , a 24-hour hike ? ''	1
eduardo confirmed , and noah sat down on the concrete edge of the fountain , stretching out his legs .	1
`` awesome surprise to find you guys here , too , '' noah smiled at wara and nazaret .	1
wara swallowed hard .	1
`` yeah , i ? ca n't believe it . ''	1
the surprise of having him show up here in the plaza in coroico , just like that , had still not worn off .	1
she had to think of something normal to say .	1
`` i remember ? last week your parents were supposed to come , right ? ''	1
the last time wara ran into noah at the martirs , he had mentioned his parents were going to come to bolivia .	1
his parents were wealthy and did not believe in god .	1
they were really not happy their son had decided to study social work and come to one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere .	1
hurt glinted in noah 's eyes when he told her they were thinking of stopping by cochabamba .	1
briefly .	1
on their way to a beach resort in brazil .	1
now , noah set his jaw and looked away .	1
`` nope .	1
they did n't come .	1
decided they just could n't do it .	1
hotels here are n't up to their sky high standards . ''	1
noah quickly changed the subject .	1
`` we 're going to rent a jeep to drive us down to the waterfalls tomorrow .	1
you guys want to come with us ? ''	1
but wara 's heart was going crazy .	1
noah should despise her after how she 'd acted the other day , but he was still smiling .	1
and so ? nice to her .	1
could it really just be a coincidence that she and noah had both showed up here , at the same place , at the same time ?	1
she did n't think so .	1
maybe there was a chance noah could love her .	1
because maybe god was behind this .	1
the idea nearly made her cry .	1
she knew nazaret would n't be thrilled about hanging out with the guys all day tomorrow ; noah was already like a brother to her , always over at the martirs ' wrestling with her little siblings or mowing the lawn .	1
and wara did n't think she was ready to hang out with noah yet .	1
she needed time to think about this .	1
to squash the hope that right now was blooming to life .	1
`` uh ? thanks .	1
but we should just let you guys have guy time , '' wara said .	1
`` yeah , tomorrow wara and i were going to spend some time alone , '' nazaret grinned at them .	1
`` set our priorities straight .	1
mediate .	1
all that . ''	1
`` suit yourselves , '' tobias waved them away , pretending to be offended .	1
`` your loss .	1
you miss seeing us without our t-shirts in the waterfall . ''	1
tobin , ever the clown .	1
wara could barely compose herself enough to cheek-smooch all the guys goodbye and make it back to the hotel .	1
there must be some reason god was doing this .	1
and it had to be something good ?	1
right ?	1
7 white plaster alejo shut the metal door of the orange three-story house he shared with gabriel and benjamin and stepped out onto the lazy peaceful street only a thursday morning in coroico could deliver .	1
and only in coroico could one have a view such as alejo and the guys had every time they stepped out their front door .	1
their front steps lowered to a street with a steep downward slope , rushing down the mountain and leaving a breath-taking view of jade mountains peaks and scarlet flowering trees in the distance .	1
their street was just a narrow lane of stone stairs , really , used only for foot traffic .	1
a corridor of tangerine and violet flowers grew wild in the dirt , forming a living rainbow along the center of the staircase .	1
gabriel sat on the second step from the top , elbows propped on his knees , staring at the clouds misting up over the trees in the distance .	1
he wore a turtleneck , as he had every day since the attack in pakistan a month ago .	1
his pale green eyes reflected the weak rays of the early morning sun , glazed , vacant , and bleak .	1
alejo sighed and covered the few steps to slide down onto the cool concrete step next to him .	1
`` 'morning , '' alejo croaked , then cleared his throat .	1
`` i think we 're late to breakfast . ''	1
gabriel half-turned towards him and parted his lips , tried to think of something to say , then gave up .	1
his gaze went back to the mist in the distance .	1
`` you sure you want to come along this weekend ? ''	1
alejo pressed his lips together .	1
`` you can take more time off , you know . ''	1
after alejo got the call from ishmael in peshawar , the twenty hour trip from here to gabriel had seemed to take forever .	1
gabriel had recovered well since that day , but the playfulness seemed to be gone from his eyes .	1
most of his free time was spent praying or playing really melancholy music on the violin his parents gave him .	1
`` i know , '' gabriel nodded .	1
he swatted at a mosquito that was whining its way around his ear .	1
`` i rested a lot last week though , at mom 's house .	1
she about had a heart attack when you called her and told her about the skiing accident in france .	1
stupid person who installed barbed wire on the slopes . ''	1
his mouth twitched and some of the old sparkle glowed in gabriel 's eyes .	1
`` i mean , what a freak accident , right ?	1
running into wire at neck level while skiing ? ''	1
now even alejo almost laughed .	1
that 's where gabriel 's family thought he went when he disappeared with his friends for weeks at time : skiing in france .	1
it felt good to smile .	1
gabriel seemed happy thinking about his mom , and the week at her house had fattened him up a bit .	1
`` it 's just , i feel weird , you know , '' gabriel sighed , still batting at the stupid mosquito .	1
`` like i should n't be here .	1
i mean , i see how pretty everything is here in coroico , and i am so happy to be alive .	1
but i should be dead . ''	1
one of his hands drifted to his throat and gabriel 's adam 's apple bobbed .	1
`` god gave me back my life , but now i feel that my life has to totally belong to him , you know ?	1
and what if i do n't do what he wants ?	1
what if i mess up ? ''	1
gabriel paused , and wrinkled his nose .	1
`` does that make any sense ? ''	1
`` god would n't save your life just so you can feel all tortured about it , '' alejo frowned .	1
`` he saved you because he loves you , not so you can be his slave the rest of your life . ''	1
gabriel looked at alejo , one sandy eyebrow raised .	1
`` yeah , but imagine how ticked off he 'll be if after he saved my measly little life i sit around living for myself instead of doing everything i can to serve him . ''	1
`` did ishmael talk to you about all this ? ''	1
alejo asked , suddenly feeling cold as he remembered the trip with the khan to the tribal area .	1
`` he 's not trying to tell you to go spend the rest of your redeemed life as a taliban fighter or something , right ? ''	1
`` no ! ''	1
gabriel actually smiled now and stood up , dusting off his sweat pants .	1
`` can you see me with all those tough guys , wearing a turban ?	1
i ca n't even grow a beard ! ''	1
alejo had to laugh at the image of gabriel wielding an ak-47 and smoking opium in the middle of the desert .	1
`` who knows ? ''	1
gabriel put his hands on both hips , and stretched a little , leaning to one side .	1
`` whatever allah has for me might even be good . ''	1
`` and it might even include ambrin . ''	1
gabriel scoffed , but seemed quite pleased by the thought .	1
`` let 's go over to the caf , '' he grinned .	1
`` i 'm starving . ''	1
gabriel and alejo joined the rest of the team in the caf attached to the side of the modest kory tours office , which at present was sealed shut by a padlocked , roll-down metal door until office hours began .	1
the tour agency was their cover here in coroico , keeping them all employed in the eyes of this lazy tropical town .	1
benjamin also worked as a doctor in a little clinic sponsored by the government of iran .	1
stalin spent his mornings at the local elementary school , teaching , of all things , morality and ethics class .	1
the two of them now sat at one of the caf 's small tables , leisurely spreading jam and margarine onto fresh bread from the corner store .	1
lzaro hummed behind the counter in the food prep space , sporting a white apron and pouring steaming organic espresso from coroico into glazed ceramic mugs .	1
`` hey , good morning ! ''	1
lzaro called cheerfully .	1
he kicked the mini refrigerator door closed after replacing the milk .	1
`` come on and have breakfast !	1
fresh marraqueta bread , and i 'm letting you all have some of my brownies . ''	1
alejo grinned and he and gabriel scraped some chairs over to the tiny table with the others .	1
lzaro had learned to make awesome brownies and cheesecake from his mom back in puerto rico , and his desserts made the caf really popular with tourists .	1
`` sure , i think i could choke down one of your brownies today . ''	1
gabriel casually nodded his thanks as lzaro plopped down a mug of strong creamy coffee in front of him .	1
`` or two .	1
depends on how much i think you need to have your self-esteem improved today by me eating your food so you wo n't , you know , think it 's gross or anything .	1
oww ! ''	1
a stale circle of bread flew through the air from where lzaro had returned behind the counter and thumped gabriel in the side of the head .	1
gabriel rubbed his head in mock pain as alejo jerked crossly towards lzaro .	1
`` hey !	1
he 's got to be careful , you know . ''	1
alejo knew that the worst of gabriel 's injury was healed , but he still felt protective , maybe guilty that something so awful had happened to a member of his team and he had n't been able to stop it .	1
`` so , '' stalin mumbled around a large mouthful of bread smothered in jelly , `` we 're gon na meet our clients half way up the trail , right ? ''	1
alejo made a face at the sight of crumbs spewing across the table .	1
`` yeah , all eight of the paraguayans are going to meet us up there . ''	1
they would meet on the trail up to uchumachi , the mountain top where kory tours led the wilderness survival tours that were completely booked every other week by prism trainees .	1
everyone down here in coroico thought the kory tour guys were up there teaching survival skills to tourists from all over south america .	1
uchumachi was isolated , perfect for alejo and his team to train others .	1
this weekend would be extra busy , because there would be a special guest : ishmael khan , all the way from pakistan .	1
it had been a year since the khan had attended one of their trainings , but he claimed that it was long overdue , that he had missed bolivia and missed them all .	1
alejo suspected that he mainly wanted to check on gabriel , his `` nephew '' , who had given him quite a scare .	1
as the junior member of the leadership team , lzaro was staying behind to man the caf and kory tours .	1
lzaro did n't mind terribly much , well aware that the gringa girls who came to the caf for organic coffee thought he looked hot in the irish tweed hat he always wore and that white apron .	1
the caf would n't have any business without his brownies , anyway , so it was a logical choice .	1
`` so , we 'll be back on monday afternoon , then . ''	1
alejo clasped hands briefly with lzaro , and swung one of the streamlined north face backpacks full of supplies they had prepared last night onto his back .	1
`` tuesday we 'll start getting everything ready for the crusade . ''	1
alejo and his team had already picked the spot for the operation against salazar , a greasy sandwich kiosk in cochabamba 's market where the man met his old college buddy every second friday of the month .	1
the street was packed and hemmed in by tall buildings .	1
no one would ever know where the sniper 's bullet had come from .	1
`` call me with any news , '' alejo instructed half-way out the door , then turned back to snatch another brownie off the table .	1
`` thanks for breakfast . ''	1
`` anytime ! ''	1
lzaro called , tipping the brim of his hat to them all .	1
as they left , alejo could have sworn he saw lzaro checking his reflection in the bamboo-framed mirror along the wall , flicking off stray bread crumbs with a satisfied smile .	1
it was 8:30 in the morning on sunday when alejo 's sat phone buzzed with a call .	1
the group had just finished a discussion called `` ethical questions related to justice '' and were now lounging around debating and munching granola bars for breakfast .	1
he pulled the phone out of the leg pocket of his pants , glancing at the screen for id .	1
`` lzaro . ''	1
alejo wandered from the clearing and entered the relative coolness of the forest at the top of the uchumachi mountain .	1
a thick cloud of mist still hung over the tops of the tangled foliage , not yet burned away by the mid-morning tropical sun .	1
`` alejo .	1
i 've got news . ''	1
lzaro 's voice twitched with excitement .	1
`` the speaker for the crusade we 've been planning ? .he 's down here .	1
i saw him . ''	1
alejo blinked , suddenly at a loss for words .	1
`` uh , he 's there ?	1
in coroico ? ''	1
was n't that what lzaro had just said ?	1
`` do you know why ? ''	1
`` yeah , you 're going to love this .	1
it appears the guy is some kind of amateur sculptor and he entered that contest here in coroico this weekend .	1
i saw the guy walk by on the sidewalk this morning , when i was setting up the caf .	1
he 's with five staff members , and i followed them over to henrich 's for breakfast .	1
i got a table close to theirs out on the porch and heard , like , everything they said . ''	1
a long , long pause .	1
`` he 's going to thailand again , '' lzaro said .	1
`` after her leaves coroico , the day after tomorrow . ''	1
alejo clenched his teeth , hard .	1
`` ok , i 'm not sure you really want to hear the rest , '' lzaro rambled on , `` but you 're going to anyway . ''	1
gabriel appeared next to alejo and alejo punched the sat phone 's speaker button since they were away from the others and a thousand feet above coroico .	1
lzaro 's voice blared distorted out of the phone 's miniature speakers .	1
`` after they finished breakfast , i took a little stroll through the plaza to check out the sculpture exhibition , which i had not done since i 've been so darn busy at work this weekend .	1
i found , unfortunately , the statue that s ? that the speaker entered in the exhibition and i am just sad that i 'm the one who had to see it and be here describing it to you . ''	1
`` i need to get back to the group .	1
can you hurry this up ? ''	1
`` i 'm getting there , '' lzaro insisted crossly .	1
`` so the guy made this humongous statue out of white plaster or something .	1
i think it 's supposed to be himself as some great benefactor .	1
he 's got himself sitting on a chair , and then around him are four little boys on the ground , looking at him .	1
there 's an older boy , like maybe twelve , sitting on the guy 's lap .	1
there 's a lot of detail in this thing , so i go closer and see that all the kids have either a little notebook or backpack with their name engraved on it .	1
like i said , wish you were here . ''	1
alejo rubbed his temple and spoke before allowing himself to think .	1
`` did any of them say ruben ? ''	1
there was a long pause , and then lzaro said , cautiously , `` now that 's freaky .	1
how did you know ?	1
that 's the kid on the guy 's lap . ''	1
alejo 's head reeled but he managed to focus , fingers digging into the phone .	1
rage filled him , and he let it , anything to keep away the tears he really did n't want gabriel seeing .	1
gabriel leaned against a fat banana plant , visually disturbed .	1
`` what are you going to do , che ? ''	1
`` i 'll call you back . ''	1
alejo flipped the phone shut and jammed it into his pocket .	1
he and gabriel stared at each other for a moment , and then alejo whirled around and began to pace .	1
fallen eucalyptus leaves perfumed the air as his sandals crushed them into the ground .	1
`` we have to move the crusade up , '' he told gabriel , still pacing .	1
`` i agree .	1
we have to do it before the trip to thailand . ''	1
alejo slammed a fist into the trunk of the banana plant , swearing loudly .	1
ruben !	1
to think that after all this time , salazar still remembered , was still gloating .	1
and why should n't he ?	1
no one cared , no one was going to make him pay .	1
where was justice ?	1
apparently , hiding her eyes .	1
no , god is justice , and his eyes are always on the earth , to reward the righteous and punish the wicked .	1
and right now , i 'm his hands .	1
god help me if i just sit here and watch without doing something .	1
gabriel was trying to calm him down .	1
`` listen , che , i 've got all the equipment we need at boris ' house .	1
i can hike into town and find a new spot .	1
i do n't need a lot of time to do calculations . ''	1
alejo narrowed his eyes at gabriel , feeling possessed .	1
he tried to concentrate , running through the same arguments he had had with himself on too many occasions .	1
are you really thinking of killing the guy ?	1
murder is a sin .	1
yeah ? but so is allowing the innocent to be hurt or killed .	1
are there other options ?	1
let the national authorities punish him according to the law ... that really had n't gone so well in the past .	1
salazar and anyone with the power to do anything were constantly scratching each others ' backs .	1
a total indifference to his activities had only made salazar more bold in breaking the law , knowing no one would care .	1
`` no . ''	1
alejo stopped in his tracks and held up one hand .	1
`` in cochabamba the sniper could easily get away .	1
it ca n't work here in coroico . ''	1
gabriel seemed crushed .	1
`` coroico is too small , '' alejo continued , `` too nosy .	1
everyone sees everything , and the population here is too small for us to avoid suspicion in the investigation .	1
but i have an idea .	1
tell me honestly if you can do this . ''	1
he explained his idea to gabriel , whose lips twitched into a smile , then broadened into a genuine grin as he received the challenge to put his considerable talents into action-now .	1
gabriel let out a low whistle and looked at alejo .	1
`` sounds great , but there 's always the possibility of more people being onsite besides just the speaker .	1
the staff , for sure , would be collateral . ''	1
`` of course , '' alejo said .	1
`` let them be collateral .	1
they know , i 'm sure of it .	1
they 're with him almost 24/7 . ''	1
`` oh , this is going to be fun ! ''	1
gabriel 's eyes were shining again , and he pounded alejo on the shoulder before turning back towards the clearing .	1
`` i 'll get some stuff from boris ' place .	1
then , i 'm going to mail a package . ''	1
gabriel marched happily back towards the khan and the other guys , probably to share the good news that they would get to be part of the operation as a bonus to the weekend .	1
alejo slowly slid down against the trunk of the sleek banana plant and buried his face into his arms .	1
8 scarlet this would never , ever happen back in ohio .	1
noah stood on the edge of a jagged black boulder , wet from bare feet to shoulder with icy spray from a nearby sixty-foot waterfall .	1
two sapphire butterflies slowly flapped their powdery wings as they rested on noah 's right bicep , inhaling droplets of water from his exposed skin with their thin black tube mouths .	1
a dozen more butterflies soared through the spray near him , dodging clouds of crystalline mist tossed off the roaring waterfall .	1
they formed a living rainbow of jade , coral , buttercup yellow , and scarlet , flitting in circles around noah 's body , landing on tobin 's and tobias ' legs .	1
lzaro from kory tours , who was working even late sunday afternoon , waited for them down below next to a basket full of fresh picked mangos and oranges for a snack before they headed back to coroico .	1
it was may , nearly winter in bolivia , but here the earth was still full of butterflies and tangled flowers .	1
if noah were home in ohio , he would probably be sprawled on the couch in sweats , watching american idol reruns and eating doritos .	1
thank you god for letting me be here .	1
bolivia is beautiful .	1
this waterfall was the third noah and the guys had visited this afternoon with lzaro in the hired kory tours pick-up truck .	1
noah now stood next to the foaming pool that formed the base of the waterfall .	1
the climb around the edge of the pool , grabbing frigid rocks for support , had been awesome ; making it to the back of the roaring waterfall , staring through the rushing water from the darkened cave behind it , had been unbelievable .	1
now the sun was beginning to drop behind the forested mountains , and the chill of wet clothes caused noah to sigh and admit that it was time to change and head back to town .	1
for a huge dinner , hopefully .	1
with all the hiking and rock-climbing they had done today , he felt that tonight he would eat like a horse .	1
and sleep like a baby .	1
`` c'mon , i think we should go . ''	1
eduardo had worked his way back from behind the falls and now stood ankle-deep in swirling water next to noah .	1
he leaned close to be heard over the pounding of water upon water .	1
`` it 's getting late . ''	1
`` sure , ok , '' noah mouthed , and gently flicked the blue butterflies off his arm , sorry to see them go .	1
the two australians had already begun to climb down the wet , slippery rocks high above the truck , baseball caps dripping water down their sun-burned faces .	1
noah slipped into the cold water , feeling the push of the uneven pebbles at the pool 's bottom against his feet .	1
being tall was an advantage in this case , and he did n't find it too difficult to discover all the handholds and make it safely back to the flat ground close to the road .	1
all of the guys pulled on the t-shirts that they had left strewn across some scrubby plants near the truck , and then sat on dry boulders in silence , eating juicy mangos , letting their soaked shorts and legs dry a little in the sun .	1
it was good they had brought kory tour 's truck instead of the jeep .	1
at least now they would n't have to get the seats of the jeep wet and squishy with their behinds .	1
noah smiled to himself , wiped his sticky fingers on the sides of his shorts , then got up and followed the guys to the truck .	1
they made sure everyone had their cameras , phones , and was wearing shoes , then swung themselves up into the bed of the rusted white pickup , sitting on the sides .	1
tobias went up front to keep lzaro company , and as soon as he had slammed the pickup door , they bumped their way back onto the road , headed to coroico .	1
`` so , what did you guys think ? ''	1
lzaro turned around to look at them through the open back window of the truck 's cab , hands casually gripping the wheel .	1
the guy 's english had a funky british accent going on ; lzaro told them he had gotten his masters in england .	1
`` are n't the falls awesome ? ''	1
`` oh my gosh , yeah , '' tobin said , practically yelling to be heard over the noise created by speeding over the uneven road .	1
`` that was the most fun i 've had in a long time .	1
kayaking yesterday was cool though , too . ''	1
`` lzaro is the man for kayaking ! ''	1
eduardo said loudly .	1
`` this guy taught me everything i know about camping . ''	1
noah and eduardo had come to coroico before and spent the day kayaking with lzaro as their guide last year .	1
it was great that lzaro had been available this year , because the guy was a lot of fun and knew everything about the great outdoors .	1
he even had a workshop in town where he brought people in from little villages around coroico and taught them how to promote the cool things in nature right in their towns for when the tourists came .	1
`` so you guys are going to cotapata tomorrow , right ? ''	1
lzaro asked , adjusting a pair of dark shades over his eyes and pulling his wool irish cap down against the glare of the setting sun .	1
his pearly teeth shone against his tan as he grinned at them in the rearview mirror .	1
`` yep , '' eduardo said .	1
`` we 're really pumped for this hike . ''	1
cotapata national park was going to be amazing .	1
a diverse ecosystem , filled with species that ranged from the giant condor to the spider monkey .	1
lzaro let up on the gas a little bit now , as coroico was getting closer and a higher speed could be risky with more vehicles on the road .	1
spiky bushes laden with tiny red coffee beans lined the road , and behind them glossy banana plants sprouted , bundles of ripening violet bananas clustering from their stalks .	1
the citric aroma of the three oranges noah had eaten wafted to his nostrils , still on his skin , and he inhaled deeply .	1
this was tropical paradise .	1
the pickup slowed down even more as they rounded a curve in the gravel and came across a girl walking along the edge of the road .	1
the long indian skirt and maroon bandana tied over her hair caused noah to stare for a second before he realized they were familiar because he was looking at wara , walking back into coroico .	1
`` hey , stop the truck ! ''	1
he called to lzaro , leaning forward to bang on the outside of the cab .	1
tiny pebbles skidded as lzaro calmly slid the truck to a stop , still to wara 's back .	1
noah leaned over the side of the truck .	1
`` tu , mujer ! ''	1
he called out in his most booming voice .	1
`` you , woman ! ''	1
eduardo , also realizing it was wara , crossed his arms and looked down at the ground , laughing .	1
wara whipped her head around with startled eyes , then her face spread into a smile when she saw who was in the back of the truck .	1
`` hey , guys ! ''	1
she said in english , waving .	1
`` you scared me !	1
again .	1
are you heading back into town ? ''	1
`` yeah , '' noah said .	1
`` can we give you a ride ? ''	1
she shrugged .	1
`` ok , sure .	1
i was taking a walk , but i 've been gone for a long time now and it 's staring to get dark . ''	1
she walked over to the truck and climbed up into the back before tobias could even get out of the front to offer her the more comfortable seat .	1
`` go up front ! ''	1
eduardo smiled at her , motioning for tobias to be a gentleman .	1
`` it 's dusty back here . ''	1
`` it 's fine , '' wara waved away his concern .	1
`` we 're , like , almost there . ''	1
eduardo and tobin were taking up most of the space on one of the small pickup 's sides , so wara came and sat down next to noah , tucking the fabric of her pretty skirt between her knees .	1
`` thanks , man !	1
we can go now ! ''	1
noah called to lzaro , and the truck zoomed to life , sending gusts of wind flowing around their bodies again .	1
little strands of wara 's dark hair were tickling her face , and noah leaned forward to kiss her on the cheek and say , `` hola ! ''	1
`` hola ! ''	1
she said back , seeming a little nervous .	1
wara 's probably not used to riding in the back of pickups .	1
i should have made tobias get out of the front .	1
`` so , what have you been doing today ? ''	1
he asked her , casually balancing one of his arms on the side of the truck close to her back in case they hit a bump .	1
would n't want to lose her .	1
`` oh , well , mostly just exploring , enjoying time by myself since nazaret left this morning .	1
the martirs came to pick her up on the way to another bible conference in caranavi .	1
i just came from that really cool restaurant , villa bella .	1
ever go there ? ''	1
`` yeah , . ''	1
noah remembered .	1
`` that place run by the hippy lady and her family .	1
yoga classes upstairs .	1
in the middle of the jungle .	1
their homemade ice cream rocks ! ''	1
`` uh-huh , and it 's all organic . ''	1
wara smiled , apparently distracted from fears of falling out of the truck enough to look into noah 's eyes .	1
`` i had pineapple ice cream , and then , '' a dramatic pause , `` i got some henna tattoos .	1
just because i 'm too much of a chicken to get a real one . ''	1
her eyes twinkled , and noah realized she was n't wearing her glasses today .	1
the thought struck him that wara cadogan really was beautiful .	1
why had n't some guy snatched her up ?	1
`` wow , do we get to see , wara ? ''	1
tobin asked loudly , then flushed and cleared his throat .	1
`` i mean , depending of course on where you have them ? ok , never mind . ''	1
wara raised one eyebrow , seeming to enjoy tobin putting his foot in his mouth .	1
noah could n't help but laugh .	1
`` they 're just on my hands and feet . ''	1
wara shook her head and held out a hand and a sandaled foot for viewing .	1
`` that 's where henna tattoos work the best . ''	1
before noah 's eyes could focus on the designs wara had on her feet , lzaro 's voice came from the front of the truck : `` wara cadogan ? ''	1
noah glanced over to see his tour guide/friend staring at them in the rearview mirror , jaw hanging , eyes still hidden behind the glasses .	1
lzaro knew wara ?	1
waiting for wara to answer to her name , noah turned back to her , about to say something-until he saw her face .	1
she looked as if she had just seen a phantom appear at the foot of her bed at midnight , while wide awake .	1
`` wara ?	1
eres tu ? ''	1
lzaro kept driving , but turned around to see wara himself , staring longer than was healthy when at the wheel .	1
`` is that you ? ''	1
lzaro slid off his shades , and noah heard wara gasp , audibly .	1
`` lzaro ? ''	1
she said , unsteadily .	1
`` yeah , it 's me . ''	1
lzaro sounded unnaturally cheerful , and his eyes were glued to wara in the mirror .	1
`` imagine seeing you here . ''	1
his gaze flitted to noah , and then to noah 's arm behind wara on the truck bed wall .	1
lzaro 's face blanched , and then , after a long pause , noah heard him say , `` well , dude , i 'm not sure if i should congratulate you on your choice in women .	1
i did n't know you two were together or i could have warned you about her .	1
fun for one night , you know .	1
not quite the good little missionary girl you might expect. ``	1
noah felt his neck begin to burn , shocked by the words coming from lzaro 's mouth .	1
he whipped around towards wara and saw her cheeks painted scarlet .	1
`` why are you doing this ? ''	1
she squeaked .	1
lzaro ignored her .	1
`` she 's pretty though , is n't she , noah ? ''	1
he winked into the mirror and then slid his dark glasses back on .	1
`` enjoy . ''	1
`` stop the truck ! ''	1
wara 's hoarse voice broke into noah 's pounding head , just in time to see that they were about to pass the hotel bella vista , where the girls were staying .	1
`` i 'm getting out ! ''	1
the brakes slammed to a halt in a billow of dust and lzaro muttered , `` fine . ''	1
wara was out of the back of the truck before noah could even process what had just happened .	1
she jogged into the hotel without even looking back .	1
`` wara ! ''	1
noah called after her , absolutely furious , shivering with anger .	1
lzaro had already hit the gas , but noah stood up just as the truck jerked into action and he vaulted over the side onto the gravel .	1
the momentum threw him down onto one knee with a skid , and he leaped up and raced after wara into the hotel .	1
how could he ? what is lzaro 's problem ?	1
`` wara !	1
wait ! ''	1
noah saw her disappearing down a hallway at the back of the hotel , and he slid on the tile past a fountain and managed to stop just outside the door to her room , which slammed shut in his face .	1
muffled , gasping sobs came from inside the door , and noah froze .	1
he was angry .	1
really angry .	1
trying to compose himself , he knocked loudly on the door .	1
`` wara ? please .	1
i ca n't believe he would say that .	1
do you want me to go beat the jerk up ?	1
we actually ? he was our tour guide .	1
i know where he lives .	1
i 'll go ? ''	1
`` noah , just go away ! ''	1
wara wailed from inside , voice muffled through the thick wooden door .	1
`` i 'm going home , to cochabamba !	1
right now ! ''	1
`` i 'll ? ''	1
`` i 'm sorry ? i ca n't .	1
go away ! ''	1
she 's really serious .	1
but i 'm not letting her get on some bus or taxi alone , like this .	1
noah glanced around the empty hallway , dripping all over the hotel 's wooden parquet floor and staring at the turquoise grout in between the red tiles on the wall .	1
i 'll go back with her .	1
i do n't need to go to cotapata with the guys .	1
wara was n't going to be in the mood to discuss this at the moment ; in fact , noah could imagine her inside the hotel room , angrily throwing clothes into her purple backpack , ready to leave this place forever .	1
breaking into a run , noah bounded down the hotel 's steps three at a time and spun out onto the street .	1
he sprinted across the plaza towards his hostel to get his stuff , face still burning , images of his fist connecting with lzaro 's jawbone flashing through his mind .	1
he had better be done dropping the guys off by the time i get to the hostel , or i may have to do time in a bolivian jail for assault , noah raged .	1
what happened ?	1
i thought lzaro was a nice guy , and suddenly he turned into a lying idiot .	1
bolivian jail was n't on the menu today ; the white pickup truck was nowhere in sight when noah burst through the door of his hostel , panting like some rabid tourist from the wild .	1
he jammed the key into the lock of his room and stuffed his few clothes , in various states of muddiness , into his backpack .	1
pulling on his last pair of dry pants , noah slammed the door of their room shut and half-ran down the hall again , while dialing eduardo 's number on his cell .	1
eduardo , and the australians in the background , protested from the mexican restaurant where they had been dropped off that noah should n't miss out on their trip to cotapata just because lzaro had suddenly become a moron .	1
`` thanks guys , but i 've got to go with her , ok ?	1
sorry .	1
i 'll catch you later . ''	1
`` alright , sure .	1
we 'll miss you , man .	1
it wo n't be the same without you . ''	1
noah flipped the phone shut just as he rounded the corner into the plaza , right on the street where all the buses parked before they took off for la paz .	1
wara would need to get to la paz first , then take another bus to cochabamba .	1
at the moment , the street was dark and empty under the glowing street lamps .	1
the pharmacy where he knew they sometimes sold bus tickets when the agency was closed on sundays still had its door open , and noah could see that a man in a white lab coat was rearranging bottles behind the counter .	1
he jogged over and burst in , gasping , `` buenas noches !	1
are there any buses to la paz tonight ? ''	1
`` no , no buses tonight , '' the elderly man answered his inquiry .	1
the scent of mint pomade and syrupy orange made noah 's head buzz .	1
`` the agencies do n't want to take passengers out this late , you know .	1
not safe on that road . ''	1
oh yeah .	1
the road of death .	1
`` but buses do leave at night sometimes , do n't they ? ''	1
noah really hoped he could help wara out .	1
`` i think i rode a bus to la paz after dark one time . ''	1
`` there is that one bus , parked down there by the store . ''	1
when noah looked lost , the man came around the glass display counter and walked with noah over to the door , pointing a block to the north .	1
`` that 's a chartered bus that some group is going back to la paz in tonight .	1
the driver is over there , smoking , just outside the door .	1
maybe you could talk with him . ''	1
`` thank you very much . ''	1
noah shook the man 's leathery hand , and backed out of the pharmacy , destination medium-sized bus near the store .	1
just like the pharmacy guy said , the driver was sitting on a rubber step of the bus , smoking , wearing a cheap brown sweater and scuffed leather shoes .	1
`` can we buy a ride on this bus ? ''	1
noah asked him , trying not to appear crazed and breathless after so much running around .	1
`` for me and one other person .	1
do you have room ? ''	1
the man took a drag of his cigarette and sized noah up .	1
`` we have lots of room .	1
this bus was hired to take a certain group of people back to la paz tonight .	1
but the tickets would be expensive , so we do n't have many other passengers . ''	1
`` that 's fine , '' noah said , willing to shell out the few dollars more .	1
he could n't forget wara 's white face when lzaro had said all that crap .	1
`` how much ? ''	1
`` eighty bolivianos , '' the driver said , after a pause .	1
`` each . ''	1
noah peeled the bills out of an outer pocket of his backpack that was still dry .	1
`` what time does it leave ? ''	1
he realized he should have asked first .	1
`` right now , '' the man said , though no one else seemed to be around .	1
the bus driver shuffled up the stairs into the bus and reappeared with a ticket book , where he made noah print the two passengers ' names and identification numbers .	1
he scribbled his passport number , and then totally made up a number for wara , since he had no idea what her passport number was and at the moment really did n't care .	1
`` eight o'clock .	1
en punto , '' the driver said , carefully ripping the tickets off and passing them to noah .	1
`` on the dot . ''	1
`` sure , '' noah replied distractedly , wondering if wara would show up by then .	1
what if she did n't come ?	1
he should get back to the plaza so he would n't miss her .	1
noah walked back to the plaza , ignoring the tempting aroma of frying hamburgers from a silver food cart on the corner .	1
a group of well-dressed people , laughing together in muted tones , passed him , headed towards the bus .	1
noah felt a moment of panic .	1
what if the last bus out tonight left without them ?	1
right then , like magic , wara came towards him across the plaza , nearly flying .	1
she was wearing jeans instead of that beautiful skirt and noah would have recognized that light blue alpaca sweater anywhere .	1
how long had wara had it , three , four years ?	1
noah slid down onto an empty bench right in her path , feet planted on the ground , really hoping she would n't be angry .	1
`` hey , '' he said , as wara stopped cold in front of him .	1
she looked devastated , red eyes visible even in the dim lighting of the plaza .	1
`` please do n't be mad , but i got some bus tickets for us .	1
it was n't easy , cause , like , no buses were going out tonight , but i found a special one that i think will be really nice .	1
it 's leaving right now . ''	1
wara 's mouth opened and then snapped shut .	1
she stared at the two tickets noah clutched in his hand .	1
`` i 'm gon na go back to cochabamba with you , '' he added , just in case he had forgotten to mention that part of his plan .	1
`` i just did n't want you to go all alone . ''	1
he paused , noticing her lip was quivering .	1
`` are you mad ? ''	1
wara burst into tears , and then tried to hide it by taking a deep breath .	1
`` but ? your trip ? ''	1
`` who cares ? ''	1
noah shrugged .	1
`` another time . ''	1
he got up and held out his hand for wara to hand him her backpack .	1
`` c'mon , i think i saw the guys who hired this bus heading over there , so we 'd better hurry up . ''	1
amazingly , wara allowed herself to be led over to the bus , whose engine was now purring lustily , and they climbed up the steps into the darkened interior .	1
inside , the bus was only about a third full , most of the people sitting towards the back in a group , settling in for a nap on the way back to the capital .	1
the men wore slick jackets with dress shirts , and most of the women seemed to be wearing pantsuits of some kind .	1
probably the group who chartered the bus .	1
not very comfortable clothes for traveling .	1
noah squinted at their tickets , and then found the seat numbers on the right side , pretty near the front .	1
he put wara 's purple backpack under the seat by the window , and then he waited , a little nervously , for wara to get into her seat first .	1
she 's not talking to me .	1
is she mad ?	1
of course she 's mad -- -the stuff lzaro said !	1
that idiotic jerk .	1
why would he spout off like that about wara ?	1
noah felt his face get hot again as he slid into his spot next to the aisle and he wondered how wara could be so quiet .	1
`` why are you doing this ? ''	1
he heard wara 's broken voice echo in his brain , and he leaned back into his seat with a sigh .	1
oh god , i really need some help right now , cause i 'm really angry .	1
help me to love my enemy-that 's who our psychopathic tour guide has suddenly morphed into-and make this sudden turn of events work according to your plan .	1
noah turned his eyes to wara , and saw , with a twist of his heart , that she had leaned forward to rest her forehead against the velvet seat back in front of her , tears sliding silently down her cheeks and dripping onto the floor .	1
9 silver never before had wara truely understood the expression `` i wanted to crawl into a hole and die . ''	1
noah sat next to her , and she wanted to die , just die .	1
what was he even doing here ?	1
nothing was ever going to be ok between them ever again .	1
she barely noticed as the last of the passengers filed onto the bus , sitting somewhere behind her and noah .	1
good .	1
her eyes were so bloodshot and swollen from sobbing in the hotel room that she could n't even pretend to be civil to anyone in the mood to talk .	1
wara stared out the window , nervously winding her foot up in the strap of her backpack under the seat , again feeling her eyes sting .	1
`` she 's a lot of fun for one night .	1
not the good little missionary girl you may imagine ? enjoy ! ''	1
his voice ran through her head without her permission , and wara blinked away the tears , truly wishing for that dark hole and covers to pull over her head and hide -- -forever .	1
with a soft hiss , the bus door closed and the vehicle rumbled to life .	1
she sat in a daze as the bus began to crawl its way along the narrow , darkened streets , leaving coroico behind .	1
the hum of the highway enveloped them and wara slumped forward against the seat back , miserable .	1
she knew he was there and was going to say something eventually , but she actually jumped when noah 's voice broke the silence .	1
`` i ca n't believe lzaro would just make up all that stuff about you , '' he spat .	1
she glanced at him for a millisecond and saw that his jaw was squared , eyes stormy .	1
`` i mean , what is his problem ?	1
this is the second time we used his tour group to do stuff here in coroico , and i thought the guy was cool .	1
how in the world did he ? ''	1
the look on wara 's face must have cut him off .	1
noah thinks lzaro made it all up .	1
her heart broke then and she felt herself staring at him , pale in the moonlight streaming through the window .	1
`` it was n't a lie . ''	1
she nearly gagged on the words .	1
`` i used to date him . ''	1
`` huh ? ''	1
noah blinked .	1
wara felt her face crumple .	1
`` oh , noah !	1
why did you come with me ?	1
you should have stayed ? do you want to go back ?	1
we 're barely out of town . ''	1
now she was blubbering , but the memory of everything was taking over : the things lzaro said .	1
things that had happened that first year .	1
`` no .	1
there 's no way i 'm letting you stay on this bus yourself . ''	1
noah still seemed a little stunned by what she had just said .	1
`` you used to date lzaro ? ''	1
`` for like six weeks .	1
the first year i lived in cochabamba .	1
we met at a church youth thing . ''	1
this breath , this space in the universe she now occupied next to noah , who she loved and had to confess these things to , was without question the worst moment in her life .	1
if she could just say what had happened , she might curl into the seat and die in peace , next to noah .	1
`` so one night , '' she mumbled , `` i had too much to drink . ''	1
like the other night .	1
for a little while , wara had totally forgotten about that lovely scene at caf paris .	1
new waves of shame washed over her .	1
her hands twisted the hem of her sweater into a pulp .	1
`` and it was like he said .	1
that night was the last time i saw him ? because i could n't handle seeing him after what happened . ''	1
she was telling all this to the velvet pattern on the back of the seat , terrified to look at noah and see his disgust .	1
he was n't looking at the girl he thought he knew , and now he realized the truth about her .	1
`` wara , '' he started , but she cut him off , laughing breathlessly .	1
`` and that 's not everything !	1
the morning after it happened , we were supposed to fly to puerto rico together for his brother 's wedding .	1
he made such a big deal about it , because he said he 'd never had a 'nice ' girlfriend before to take home to meet his family and he knew his mom was going to be all proud of him .	1
lzaro 's parents even paid for our tickets . ''	1
wara felt dizzy , and she squeezed her eyes shut .	1
had she really done all this ?	1
she 'd spent so long trying not to think about it , pretending she was the kind of person who would never act this way .	1
but it was all true .	1
she licked her lips , determined to finish the story .	1
`` so , the last night i saw lzaro , he gave me five thousand dollars for the trip , just to keep for him because in the morning he had to stop in the market and get a present for his mom and he did n't want to get robbed there on the way to the airport .	1
and ? he also gave me the diamond wedding ring for his brother 's wife .	1
she had him buy it in bolivia , because it was cheaper than in puerto rico .	1
that was at dinner .	1
but later , i felt so horrible about everything that i never showed up to go to puerto rico in the morning .	1
i just stood lzaro up at the airport .	1
i went to montana for four months and never talked to him again .	1
when i came back to cochabamba he was gone .	1
i just ran away from him , because it was easier to just not think about it .	1
never gave him back the money and the ring .	1
he definitely hates me now . ''	1
there , she 'd told him everything .	1
there was a giant split somewhere inside her heart : this adventurous girl who loved languages and jesus and living here in bolivia .	1
and then , on the dark side , this liar who had slept with a guy while working as a missionary and never had the guts to face him afterwards .	1
she felt like she had just turned herself inside out , here on this bus in front of noah : the rotten inside she always kept hidden from the world was now revealed , stinking up this bus , her entire life .	1
noah was speaking , but focusing on his voice was a struggle .	1
`` but you repented . ''	1
the tone was a statement , not a question .	1
`` and god forgave you . ''	1
`` yes . ''	1
wara shrugged weakly .	1
`` but it does n't feel like it . ''	1
noah pulled wara 's chin up with one finger , until her face was tilted towards his .	1
`` c'mon , look at me ! ''	1
he insisted .	1
wara tried , but abject humiliation would n't let her eyes connect with his .	1
`` in that story jesus told , '' he said , `` the father took his son back after he spent everything in wild living , like we all do . ''	1
noah took both of wara 's hands in his and leaned in closer .	1
`` but when the son came back , the father did n't just let him slave away as a servant .	1
he threw a party .	1
he loves you , wara .	1
you 're back . ''	1
noah 's adam 's apple bobbed and he paused , gazing out the window behind wara , seemingly lost in thought .	1
a moment later his eyes rounded and he jerked his gaze back to her .	1
his grip on her hands tightened .	1
and he was staring at her .	1
wide-eyed and staring .	1
`` i have something to give you , '' he finally said , releasing her hands hastily and digging around in his pocket .	1
wara 's gaze spiraled to the floor , still dizzy with shame in spite of noah 's reminder that she was forgiven .	1
nice words , yeah .	1
god could forgive , but how could he ever feel same about her , seeing what she had done ?	1
it was one thing to not punish her for her sins , and quite another to still like her , to want to spend time with her .	1
the same for noah .	1
he was witness to her worst moment .	1
maybe several worst moments .	1
he could still be nice , but he would never look at her without thinking about ? that .	1
her heart was aching when she felt noah slide closer , wrapping one long arm around her shoulder .	1
wara inhaled sharply and met his eyes , completely confused .	1
noah was touching her ?	1
he was supposed to be repulsed .	1
he sat like that in silence for a full minute , eyes flickering , obviously running through something in his head .	1
then he slid his arm from her shoulder and scooted back to his own seat , fist tightly closed around something in his left hand .	1
`` i have something to ? to ask you , '' he announced , and the goofy grin that began to spread across his face caused wara to blink .	1
`` now might not be a good time .	1
in fact , you just might kill me .	1
but we 've known each other for a really long time now , so i just ? ''	1
noah 's voice faltered and wara sniffed , completely mystified .	1
he better not be about to ask me advice about some sin problem he has , now that we 're on the subject and he happens to have a friend here who is quite familiar with sinfulness !	1
`` ? i just have this ? for you , '' noah was going on .	1
`` feel free to laugh at me , as long as it makes you feel better . ''	1
wara 's eyes focused blankly on a silver ring engraved with arabic letters that noah was holding out towards her , glimmering in the faint light from the front of the bus .	1
`` wara , i ? ''	1
noah shot her a lopsided smile and murmured to himself , `` you 're doing this all wrong . ''	1
he leaped to his feet , almost banging his head on the bus 's dark ceiling , and managed to get down on one knee in the aisle .	1
wara 's eyes popped and flashed between the silver ring and noah .	1
what ?	1
had he gone crazy ?	1
`` ok , now i 'm sweating , '' noah said , rubbing a hand across his face and sucking in a deep breath .	1
`` i 'm kind of messing this up .	1
this ring is something i got in egypt when i studied there for a semester when i was twenty .	1
i kept it for a while , to give to the unlucky girl i will attempt to trick into dating and then marrying me .	1
it says , '' noah held the ring out towards wara again , on one shaking palm , `` 'my beloved is mine and i am his ' .	1
i wanted to ask you if you would consider thinking of me like that ? if you would like to be with me ? get to know me ? think about marrying me someday !	1
if you did n't get sick of me while we 're dating , you know . ''	1
noah 's hands were shaking , though he tried to smile , and he actually seemed on the verge of tears .	1
wara 's jaw went slack as noah quickly added , `` i mean , you do n't have to decide right now , but i would like us to get to know each other .	1
i want to be with you , wara ! ''	1
`` what ?	1
you ca n't .	1
how could you ? ''	1
wara tried in vain to think of something to say , jerking around in her seat as scattered applause broke out from the back of the bus .	1
they were watching !	1
why was noah on his knees ?	1
he 's crazy !	1
he said he wanted to be with me ?	1
is this a joke ?	1
it 's not a joke-he 's sweating and waiting for me to answer !	1
he looks like he really ? still likes me ?	1
in reality , noah 's eyes said that he still loved her .	1
`` of course , i love you , '' wara blurted .	1
`` but how could you ? ''	1
`` ssshhh ? ''	1
noah hauled himself out of his scrunched up position in the aisle , laughing but looking stricken .	1
`` are you serious ?	1
you actually love me ? ''	1
noah sat down next to her again , and wara gaped at him , dumbstruck .	1
she nodded .	1
`` ok then , '' he said nervously .	1
for a moment no one spoke , and wara 's heart pounded in her ears like a tom-tom .	1
`` we , my dear , have a lot to talk about .	1
but not now .	1
let 's just rest , ok. come here ? just rest . ''	1
noah put his arm around her tentatively , watching her to make sure it as ok. as he pulled her close , he slid the silver ring on her finger and squeezed her hand .	1
all wara could do was lean against him in an amazed stupor , thinking this could not be real .	1
`` everyone in the world is desperate for grace . ''	1
the quote from a book wara had read this year exploded in her mind like sparkling firecrackers .	1
`` this is what 's unique about christianity : grace .	1
no other religion has a god who gives grace . ''	1
her heart was thudding against her ribs , but her eyelids drooped .	1
wara leaned back against the seat , noah 's arm around her , and her heart slowed until she finally fell asleep .	1
she came to consciousness as if in a dream .	1
a roaring heat swallowed her and something solid and icy smacked her in the head .	1
wara 's eyes flew open as wide as they had ever opened in her life , and what she saw was a mountain of writhing silver flames .	1
and then it was gone .	1
she tried to grab on to something , but it was like a nightmare catapult flung her into space .	1
the flames spiraled overhead again and she opened her mouth to scream , hearing only a sickening crunch of metal and glass shattering around her like crystal rain .	1
the flaming bus lifted off the ground over her head and hurdled away with a whoosh of fire and wara realized she had fallen out of the window of the bus onto her back .	1
just like that , there was nothing but the star-studded sky overhead and the most awful sound wara had ever heard in her life : metal punching against boulders as the bus rolled down the ravine .	1
screams echoed for a few seconds , and then another explosion battered the ground and all was deathly quiet .	1
wara began to shake .	1
she did n't know if she was dying , but this had to be what dying felt like .	1
there had been an accident , and ? where was noah ?	1
she had to see if she could get up , because noah had been right beside her , and he had to be right beside her still .	1
she tried to roll onto one side and was terrified to feel her head weighed about a hundred pounds .	1
she could barely move .	1
gasping for breath , wara forced her eyes to the drop-off where the entire bus had disappeared .	1
to her left was an expanse of flat ground and spiky , clumped grass .	1
she struggled to turn her head to the right and laid her cheek against the cold gravel .	1
shadowy trees bent over the ravine , dipping low in the wind towards death below .	1
there was no one there .	1
wara sprawled on the edge of the cliff , eyes unseeing , until everything faded into darkness .	1
10 midnight blue alejo was stretched out on the floor of the tent on his stomach , trying to ignore stalin 's noisy snoring , eyes boring into the darkness and having absolutely no success at sleep .	1
the sat phone 's glowing display said it was nearly midnight , and the clearing that held their tents buzzed with cicadas and singing frogs and the forest 's pulsating hum .	1
a snap cracked above the quiet chorus , and alejo jerked his head up .	1
he recognized the raucous voices that floated into the clearing as belonging to the paraguayans and bolted to his feet .	1
he unlatched the opening to the tent and jogged across the darkened clearing towards the group who was just exiting the forest .	1
gabriel and some of the guys had made the hike down towards the spot where the bus should have gone over , anxious to see the results of the hastily-planned operation .	1
it was too early for any news on the radio they had stashed with the supplies ; the heavy tropical growth down the sides of the mountain was so thick that no one passing by would even notice the bus had crashed , unless the explosion had left a pile of debris next to the highway .	1
gabriel had n't wanted any tell-tale signs left over that the accident had n't really been accidental , and so had moved in to check the scene .	1
`` hey . ''	1
alejo made out gabriel 's pale face at the front of the line .	1
he was relived to see that his friend seemed pleased .	1
`` two questions : is he dead , and does it look like an accident ? ''	1
`` 99.9 % probability , and yes , check , '' gabriel said merrily .	1
some of the others , william and marco , drew up next to gabriel , laughing too loudly , and snickering something to the guys behind them .	1
alejo finally made out the dark forms of christian , daniel , and osmar strolling casually out of the forest , hauling something between them .	1
something that had the shape of a human .	1
frowning sharply , alejo opened his mouth just as they dropped their burden to the dewy grass .	1
the person rolled over , moaning , and a head with long tresses turned to one side , revealing a white face streaked with blood .	1
alejo swore , immediately understanding what was going on .	1
he glared at all of them , including gabriel .	1
`` what were you thinking , bringing her here ?	1
she survived ? ''	1
`` yeah , she was on the bus , '' gabriel explained , happiness slightly subdued .	1
alejo noticed gabriel was carrying a purple backpack that obviously did n't belong to him , which he carelessly slung to the ground .	1
the girl moaned again and then her eyes slit open .	1
she thrashed one way and then the other , then flew up to a sitting position with a loud gasp and yelled , `` noah ! ''	1
noah ?	1
not a bolivian name .	1
`` she 's american , '' christian grinned , crooked teeth visible in the darkness .	1
`` passport in her bag . ''	1
alejo 's heart took a nose dive .	1
not one of salazar 's staff .	1
how many others ?	1
`` yeah , this is cool , huh ? ''	1
william continued the jittery prattling from alejo 's left .	1
`` we just thought you might want to share in the spoils of victory . ''	1
a few lewd comments rumbled from around the circle of men , and the american girl looked up sharply , terrified .	1
`` i w-w-was in a bus accident , '' she managed to say , in perfect spanish .	1
`` where am i ?	1
my friend was also on the bus-did you see anyone else ? ''	1
she looked around frantically , trying to get up but obviously lightheaded .	1
`` you were n't in no bus accident , sweetheart , '' william drawled , reaching out to touch her dark hair .	1
`` your bus has been bombed ? ''	1
`` basta ! ''	1
alejo snapped , pushing william back hard .	1
`` enough . ''	1
`` bombed ? ''	1
the girl 's voice faltered .	1
alejo clenched his fist and fought the urge to knock william out .	1
they should have left any survivors on the road , so they could get to help .	1
now , instead , the girl was here , in the hands of some very unsafe men , himself included .	1
alejo 's plans had n't included this possibility .	1
how could anyone have survived the explosion ?	1
this girl did n't even seem to be burned .	1
stalin , long hair fuzzy around his very sleepy face , had by now joined the rest of the guys , who stood leering and making savage jokes .	1
he rubbed his eyes , then slowly grinned , offering a hand to help the girl up from the dirt .	1
`` come on , '' he said , helping her stand up by his side .	1
`` you guys should n't talk that way around a lady .	1
it 's not her fault she ended up here with all of us .	1
was n't supposed to happen . ''	1
`` oh , cut it out , stalin ! ''	1
christian grinned .	1
`` always such a gentleman .	1
she 's going to die anyway .	1
she 's a witness .	1
we thought we might as well bring her up to join us for the party in honor of our last night in coroico . ''	1
alejo 's mind seemed full of sludge .	1
there were n't supposed to be other people on the bus .	1
only salazar and his staff .	1
but you did n't know that for sure , did you ?	1
an accusing voice bit back at him .	1
there could have been children on that bus .	1
your own family could have been on there .	1
acid scalded alejo 's stomach and he took a deep breath .	1
the girl was on the point of tears , looking all around , trying to find something .	1
or someone .	1
alejo 's mind cleared and he decided what he was going to do .	1
marching over towards stalin , alejo motioned for him to move out of the way .	1
he looped an arm under the girl 's arms and dragged her smoothly to her feet , anchoring her back against his chest .	1
her weight sagged against him , so weak she could barely protest .	1
with his free hand , alejo forced the girl 's face to tip backwards so he could see her .	1
he could feel her lower jaw trembling in his palm , and large honey-colored eyes with thick lashes met his , runny with tears .	1
alejo allowed himself to grin wolfishly .	1
then he glared at the guys who were still leering at their prisoner .	1
`` if anyone 's having any fun here tonight , it 's me .	1
sadly for all of you , i am in charge , and unless you want to have your salaries cut off by the khan himself i need all of you to get your rears back to your tents and sleep-now .	1
we 'll start tomorrow at six .	1
last session before it 's over . ''	1
alejo felt the girl 's rapid breathing as he set his jaw and pulled her back tighter against his chest .	1
a chorus of complaints arose around him , which he ignored , turning towards gabriel with a wink .	1
`` good work everyone .	1
especially you , gabo . ''	1
gabriel was staring at alejo slack-jawed as the rest of the guys gave up and whirled around to head towards their tents , muttering bitterly .	1
alejo motioned towards the purple backpack with his chin , and said , `` pass me that , will you , gabo ?	1
she and i are going to retire . ''	1
gabriel picked up the backpack and passed it over .	1
`` sorry , '' gabriel barely whispered as he leaned closer .	1
`` the other guys made me bring her .	1
but she would have had to go anyway .	1
she 's a witness . ''	1
`` yeah , i know .	1
everything 's going to work out . ''	1
alejo winked again and then said a little louder , `` you did it .	1
it worked . ''	1
`` thanks , '' gabriel said , glowing expression admitting he enjoyed the praise .	1
the girl began to squirm feebly against alejo .	1
`` what are you guys talking about ?	1
please , my friend might still be around and i have to go back ? ! ''	1
alejo plugged the girl 's mouth tightly with his hand and started towards his tent , dragging her in front of him and really hoping she would n't bite .	1
`` good night ! ''	1
he called to gabriel , then raised his voice as he approached the tent .	1
`` stalin !	1
get your butt out here with your sleeping bag .	1
bad news -- -you 're going over to bunk with benjamin . ''	1
alejo ripped open the entrance to his large tent as he heard a low moan and `` awww , man !	1
alright . ''	1
grumbling , stalin gathered up his sleeping bag and pillow , then grabbed his bottle of antacids and the ridiculous stuffed snoopy that he insisted on bringing along on every trip .	1
alejo and the girl ducked inside his tent , which was lit by a camping lantern perched on a box they always left up here in the clearing .	1
still keeping her tightly in his grip , he cautiously slid his hand off her mouth , waiting for stalin to leave .	1
she sucked in air with a shudder , still sagging against alejo .	1
stalin passed by them on his way to the door .	1
he managed to free one hand from his mass of possessions and held it out to the surviving girl , rather sadly .	1
`` the guys say your passport says you 're a missionary , senorita .	1
i admire the way you missionaries share what you believe , far away from home . ''	1
stalin sighed dramatically and then ran a finger down the girl 's bloodied cheek , almost guiltily .	1
`` i do n't think you 'll be here much longer , but if anyone ever deserved to go through those heavenly gates , i think it would be you . ''	1
`` wait !	1
please ? ? ''	1
wara tried to reach after stalin as he darted out the door .	1
`` wait ! ''	1
she screamed again , and alejo clamped his hand over her mouth and growled lowly into her ear .	1
`` i 'm not going to hurt you , ok ?	1
stop yelling .	1
i need everyone else in their tents , where they wo n't be paying any attention to you . ''	1
he removed his hand from her mouth , then scooped her up and carried her , kicking and struggling , towards his rumpled sleeping bag .	1
`` you 've got to lay down ! ''	1
he insisted , inwardly kicking himself because he knew he was scaring her to death .	1
`` you were in an accident , ok ?	1
i 've got to see how badly you 're hurt .	1
you probably have a concussion , so you need to hold still . ''	1
he tried to keep his tone calm , because the usual way he barked out orders was probably not going to make this girl stop kicking .	1
she stiffened , then curled up on the sleeping bag , eyes squeezed shut .	1
in the light of the tent 's lamp , alejo took in his captive 's dusty jeans and sweater .	1
her dark hair , coated with a fine film of dust , was streaked with burgundy highlights and scattered around her shoulders .	1
with tan skin and light brown eyes , she did n't look like the typical north american girl .	1
alejo slid to the floor of the tent , one knee in the air , and let out a long sigh .	1
after deliberation he finally said , `` i 'm sorry for the crudeness outside , but i just wanted to get you in here to keep you away from the other guys .	1
ok ? ''	1
she slit her eyes open and searched his face , as if wanting to believe him , then gave up and curled back up in a ball .	1
he did a double take , noticing the girl had coffee-colored , indian-style tattoos on her palms .	1
henna .	1
`` what 's your name ? ''	1
`` wara , '' she muttered .	1
alejo was surprised to hear a bolivian name .	1
aymara language .	1
means `` star . ''	1
a gold star ring twinkled in the america girl 's nose .	1
`` why do you have a name from bolivia ? ''	1
he saw her swallow , hard .	1
`` my grandpa was a missionary , too .	1
in peru .	1
he married a quechua lady .	1
my parents let my grandma name me and she gave me a native name . ''	1
`` are you hurt ? ''	1
alejo felt himself staring .	1
the girl 's explanation of her name had suddenly brought it home : she was very real , with a very real family somewhere who would miss her if alejo just killed her here in cold blood .	1
`` i have a medical kit , '' he said hoarsely .	1
`` cuts from broken glass ? ''	1
he sounded like an idiot .	1
his team needed him to kill this girl .	1
for the mission , he had to kill this girl .	1
and he was asking her if she needed band-aids .	1
she glared at him then , jaw clenched with anger .	1
`` why do you care ? ''	1
she hissed .	1
`` my best friend was sitting right next to me , and if you did n't find him he could be dead .	1
what have you done ? ''	1
her tone rose frantically , and she curled up tighter on his sleeping bag .	1
alejo 's stomach burned at her words ; the others on the bus had almost certainly been taken out , but he could n't think about if salazar was gone or not until he heard the news that the body was found .	1
if they ever found a body .	1
alejo stared at this girl with the nose ring in his tent and saw a life he had just utterly devastated .	1
`` who else was on the bus ? ''	1
he asked against his better judgment .	1
his mouth was bone dry .	1
wara stared at the olive wall of the tent , obviously exhausted by her tirade .	1
`` i was ? with noah .	1
i did n't really pay attention .	1
there were a bunch of people in the back in suits and then some more people came on at the last minute . ''	1
alejo felt sick .	1
more people possibly unrelated to salazar .	1
and this girl in front of him .	1
wara .	1
uncontrollable nausea welled up in the pit of alejo 's stomach , and he knew there was no holding it in .	1
`` excuse me , '' he told the girl briefly , then ripped open the door to the tent and ran outside into a nearby cluster of banana plants .	1
he threw up until there was nothing left , then wiped his chin on his t-shirt .	1
alejo sank down onto the ground with a clear view of his tent , still feeling sick and undone .	1
thankfully , it looked like everyone was in their tents snoring .	1
no one had seen him out here vomiting .	1
sucking in a slow breath , alejo tried to clear his mind and think .	1
if he helped the girl leave this place alive , he would have to leave the prism .	1
forever .	1
the guys could even be sent after him to kill him .	1
and then look for his family .	1
she would have to leave and never come back , always look over her shoulder .	1
and she would tell the authorities everything .	1
thank god the khan is gone .	1
lzaro had met him in the jungle near boris ' house tonight , and the two were driving to la paz in lzaro 's chartreuse brasilia .	1
ishmael was off to peru , then home to peshawar .	1
if ishmael were here , she 'd be dead already .	1
this time alejo felt he had no plan .	1
there was always a price to pay , he 'd learned , for doing what was right .	1
this time , the payment might have to be wara , the american missionary girl .	1
11 coffee she must be shock .	1
she had to be , because how else could she keep breathing , how else could she even think , when noah might be dead .	1
she was sprawled on a sleeping bag in some tent , captured by some dangerous guys who had probably made her bus crash and killed noah .	1
no !	1
she forced herself to erase that thought , scrub the eraser madly across the pencil lines on the page until it was gone altogether .	1
that could n't be right .	1
noah had to be just fine .	1
and it was good he was n't here , with these awful guys who had threatened wara outside .	1
she closed her eyes against the cool material of the sleeping bag , feeling sick and dizzy , but surprisingly , not in pain .	1
the thought crossed her mind that she could just get up and walk out of here , but she was sure they would catch her .	1
thoughts of noah in the bus at the bottom of the ravine paralyzed her , filling her body with lead .	1
the door of the tent rustled and the guy came back in , brooding and dangerous looking , with stormy hazel eyes .	1
she blinked , noticing he was n't wearing a t-shirt anymore .	1
the guy looked about her age , maybe five ten , wearing khaki pants with pockets everywhere and leather sandals .	1
wara cringed , because she knew whoever these guys were , this one was the leader .	1
she 'd heard how he 'd ordered the guys around outside , sending them away mumbling with muted curses .	1
and now she was stuck here with him .	1
who in the world were these guys , and where was she ?	1
what happened ?	1
the haze in wara 's mind suddenly drifted away and she dragged herself to sitting .	1
the guy with coffee-colored skin stalked over to a backpack in the corner , yanked out a gray t-shirt and pulled it over his head .	1
he eyed her , then lowered himself to sitting at the other end of the sleeping bag .	1
`` my name is paulo , '' he said .	1
`` you should sleep . ''	1
there was no way she felt like going to sleep right now .	1
in this tent , with him .	1
`` someone said something about a bomb , '' she blurted out , needing to understand what kind of situation she was in here .	1
`` please at least tell me what 's going on . ''	1
paulo pressed his lips together and folded his arms across his chest , looking even more dangerous .	1
wara fought not to shrink back .	1
`` there was a bomb on the bus , '' he said finally .	1
`` it was in a package that we mailed freight to la paz .	1
you and noah had nothing to do with it .	1
you were an accident .	1
you were n't supposed to be there . ''	1
wara stared , dumbfounded .	1
`` but , why ?	1
why would you ? what ? ? ''	1
how could she say , why did you do this to us ?	1
paulo sighed .	1
`` there are a lot of things i ca n't explain to you .	1
you were n't supposed to be there , but you were .	1
and now you 're a witness . ''	1
icy fingers ran down wara 's arms .	1
so , what ?	1
they were just going to kill her ?	1
`` so you 're just planning on killing me too .	1
like right now ?	1
what are you waiting for ? ''	1
that came out sounding much too hysterical , but wara was really scared .	1
paulo 's eyebrows lowered even more and he uncrossed his legs and rested his forearms on raised knees .	1
`` i would have had the guys just leave you on the road , for someone to find and take to the hospital .	1
you never would have known a thing . ''	1
was it her imagination or did he actually wince hearing his own words ?	1
`` but you got brought here , '' he continued , `` and so now everything is more complicated .	1
if we let you go , that causes some major problems for us .	1
i 'm going to do the best i can to think up a solution for this , ok ?	1
but no promises . ''	1
she just then noticed that this guy called paulo had a water bottle in one hand , which he held out to her .	1
`` take these . ''	1
wara felt her eyes narrow in suspicion at the sight of two huge white pills on his palm .	1
`` it 's ibuprofen , '' he said , mouth twisting wryly .	1
she took the medicine silently , draining half a bottle of water .	1
she was so thirsty .	1
`` you 're sure you 're not bleeding ? ''	1
the question made her furious as she thought about noah : where he was , if he was hurt right now .	1
bleeding .	1
she was just fine .	1
for now .	1
but when paulo pulled on a sweater and stretched himself out on the tent floor as if to sleep , claustrophobia set in .	1
`` i 'll have to wake you up every hour , '' he informed her .	1
`` since you could have a concussion .	1
and just so you know , we have motion detectors around our camp .	1
do n't try to escape .	1
we 'll catch you . ''	1
and paulo switched off the camping lamp .	1
it was pitch black in the tent , but she heard his even breathing , imagined him already sleeping , not affected at all by the way he had just destroyed her life .	1
sorrow gripped her chest like a vise and she let herself sink back into the sleeping bag .	1
she twisted the silver ring on her finger , feeling she was really in a dream .	1
in the real world , girls like her did n't survive bus crashes and get dragged off by a bunch of crazy guys as their prisoner .	1
in the real world , nice guys like noah did n't still love girls like her when they found out who they really were .	1
or give them silver rings .	1
noah .	1
oh noah .	1
how could you do that ?	1
she felt herself sinking into the ground , asleep in the tent somewhere under the stars , and in her dreams she was back in cochabamba in caf amara with noah .	1
it was three in the afternoon a few months ago , and the caf was nearly empty .	1
bittersweet chocolate and coffee from coroico scented the air , fairly dripping from the lime green silk plastered on the walls .	1
sweet corn mixed with white cheese and anise wafted from the kitchen , where dona filomena , the quechua lady who wore perpetual smile creases around her obsidian eyes , was boiling humintas in an enormous dented pot .	1
wara always imagined her in there , praying under her breath in tongues while she cooked or washed dishes , wide velvet pollera skirt swaying against the counter .	1
across from wara at a smooth wooden table , noah looked up from his toshiba tablet and said , `` so , how did it go on tuesday ?	1
did you get in trouble ? ''	1
`` huh ? ''	1
wara frowned at him , glancing up from the quechua book she d been reading while waiting for nazaret to show up .	1
the two girls were teaching a group of ladies to read in quechua at a church downtown , close to caf amara .	1
wara saw the twinkle in noah 's eye and suddenly got what he was talking about .	1
her face spread into a grin and she lay the book on the table , right over half of che guevara 's face that some local artist had painted in pastels .	1
she leaned back into the chair , raised an eyebrow at him and fingered the little gold star on the side of her nose .	1
`` about this ?	1
well , i do n't think they liked it , but i 've always been a little weird .	1
the bennesons are nice missionaries ; they did n't say anything .	1
plus , c'mon , my name means star .	1
in a bolivian language . ''	1
she peered at noah over the top of her maroon glasses , still grinning .	1
`` it 's you you should worry about .	1
just cause you did n't go to prayer meeting on tuesday does n't mean the rest of the team is n't gon na find out next time . ''	1
`` you got me . ''	1
noah ran a hand through his straggly sandy blond hair , pushing it aside to reveal a little silver hoop in his right ear .	1
`` they might be mad .	1
but i 'm not sure what the big deal is .	1
half the bolivian guys i 'm friends with here have an earring .	1
or a couple earrings . ''	1
he let the hair fall back over his ear and they both sat there , smiling , enjoying the moment of feeling like naughty missionaries .	1
well , at least one of them was n't really naughty .	1
noah was just a nice guy who wanted an earring .	1
clay dishes clinked from the kitchen and the aroma of lemon bubbles joined the coffee floating around them in the empty coffee shop .	1
footsteps scuffed on the pavement outside the open caf entrance and tiago slouched by under a black backpack covered in skull patches , wearing baggy black jeans with chains as usual .	1
noah and wara threw him a wave , and he grinned back , revealing a silver stud in his tongue wara did n't remember seeing before .	1
noah and i have a ways to go before we beat tiago in the piercing count , she thought , still smiling .	1
noah had stretched his legs out under the table and was back typing furiously at his little tablet .	1
he was squinting at the thing with extreme concentration , like a successful young stock broker in an armani suit instead of a missionary in cut-off khaki shorts that really needed a haircut .	1
`` ok , so , look at this , '' he told wara , whirling the screen around so she could see .	1
`` remember last week when we saw all those muslim ladies passing out tracts in the plaza ? ''	1
sure she did .	1
wara had been with noah and nazaret , and they had come upon a big group of women in veils , right in the plaza colon .	1
most of them were bolivians who had converted to islam through the influence of the small-but-growing muslim community here in south america .	1
the ladies had been passing out tracts about islam , and the whole scene had been kind of surreal because back in the day , christians used to be the only group you would see doing things like that .	1
wara scooted her chair closer to noah and planted an elbow right in che guevara 's eye as she positioned herself to squint at his tiny screen .	1
`` so i was checking online a little about islam , '' noah said , `` cause i was kinda curious about how it 's growing so much around here .	1
look at this website i found. ``	1
wara 's eyes fell on something like a powerpoint presentation , all in spanish , with photos of dramatic mountain backdrops fading away around the large letters .	1
`` islam is the only hope for latin america , '' the title proclaimed .	1
the following screens explained how islam really is the heritage of spanish-speaking peoples and they should return to it with all their hearts .	1
islam is the only light for latin america .	1
and islam gives us a common cause as brothers : fight against injustice and western imperialism .	1
`` that 's a little bit freaky . ''	1
wara bit her lip while meeting noah 's eyes .	1
`` the part about fighting against western imperialism .	1
the way so many people feel about western imperialism in bolivia these days , that seems like a great reason for a lot of people to join islam. ``	1
noah cocked his head to one side and shrugged .	1
she could see the earring again , and he looked kind of cute with it .	1
the thought occurred to her that there must be a ton of bolivian girls in love with this guy , and it almost made her laugh .	1
`` did n't your parents want you to be a stock broker ?	1
or something , '' she asked him , totally changing the subject .	1
noah blinked , then settled back slowly into his chair .	1
`` yeah , something like that .	1
they made me study international business .	1
and they are not too happy with me right now , as i 'm sure i told you before .	1
maybe if i wore a tie to work it would help. ``	1
they both snorted , then burst into laughter , tears leaking out of their eyes as they looked at themselves .	1
noah in the cut-off shorts and a wrinkled t-shirt with giant hawaiian flower flip-flops .	1
wara was wearing frayed jeans and yet another hippy shirt , this one a pumpkin orange with purple tie-dyed rings and little brass bells hanging from the sleeves .	1
yeah , maybe noah should start wearing a pinstripe silk tie with that outfit , when he went to play with the kids at the martirs ' aids center and give them their medicine .	1
or when he sang here at the caf .	1
tobin and tobias could get one too .	1
they both laughed and swiped tears from their eyes until nazaret came to get wara for their class .	1
12 hazel a hard whisper jerked her awake , cutting violently through the darkness .	1
the memory of where she was crushed her .	1
she and noah were n't laughing in the caf together .	1
they had been in a bus accident , and she did n't know where noah was .	1
she was here in a tent somewhere , captured by some really dangerous guys .	1
wara froze on the sleeping bag , praying that if they thought she was still asleep , they 'd leave her alone .	1
the guy who 'd kidnapped her , paulo , had woken her up a few times in the night , just to make sure she was still alive .	1
before they killed her .	1
`` hey ! ''	1
the insistent whisper came again .	1
`` time for prayers , che . ''	1
wara cracked her eyes open in the direction of the tent door and saw a thin , pale face with a little goatee leaning inside , calling paulo .	1
nylon fabric rustled as paulo staggered up off the floor , shivered , then pulled a second black sweater over his head .	1
`` ya voy , '' he whispered , and the light-skinned man disappeared , leaving the tent flap hanging open .	1
`` i 'm coming . ''	1
paulo turned his morbidly serious gaze on wara and she tensed and did her best to appear fast asleep .	1
she slit her eyes open as she heard him padding towards the door , saw that he was leaving in khaki cargo pants and bare feet .	1
after a minute , she slipped from the sleeping bag and crawled to the door of the tent , where a star-studded sky and crescent moon gave the only light .	1
was it almost early morning ?	1
or what were these guys doing up in the middle of the night ?	1
`` time for prayers , '' the man who came to get paulo had said .	1
wara frowned and bit her lip .	1
around six men were gathered in the clearing , close enough that she could pick up what they said .	1
six more men suddenly appeared out of the darkened forest , dripping water from their hair and sleeves .	1
the other six , including paulo in his black sweater , walked together into the trees and disappeared .	1
wara settled in cross-legged , watching the strange scene with bleary eyes .	1
when paulo 's group came back , also glistening with drops of water in the moonlight , all of the men lined up facing the same direction , now silent , without the excited chatter .	1
everyone bowed their heads , and then wara heard the soft rumble of them all chanting together : allaahu akbar allaahu akbar ashhadu allah ilaaha illa-lah ashhadu allah ilaaha illa-lah ash hadu anna muhamadar rasuulullah ash hadu anna muhamadar rasuulullah wara 's pulse surged , knowing what she was listening to .	1
as a linguistics geek , she could definitely recognize arabic .	1
god is great .	1
i bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except god .	1
i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of god .	1
they 're saying salaat , wara thought , absolutely stunned .	1
these guys are muslims .	1
the men , still standing , all hooked their hands behind their ears , turning their palms forward , and repeated , `` allah akbar '' in a flat monotone .	1
crossing one hand on top of the other in front of their bellies , they prayed more in arabic , though wara only caught a little .	1
the main gist seemed to be glory and praise to allah , and at the end she heard something about satan .	1
she then recognized the opening lines of the first surah or chapter of the quran .	1
all of the men outside bowed in unison , backs straight , gaze lowered .	1
wara shivered , hearing again , `` allah akbar ! ''	1
and realizing that most of the praying men wore long knives hanging from their belts in leather sheathes .	1
her attention span suddenly fizzled and she weakly crawled back to the sleeping bag , not quite sure what this new revelation meant for her .	1
she was being held captive by a group of muslims .	1
who had put a bomb on her bus .	1
for the first time she wondered where she was .	1
under the white star light outside the tent , wara had made out the shadowy bulk of mountain peaks .	1
the men must have carried her , unconscious , from the road after the accident .	1
they could n't have carried her far , could they ?	1
we could be up on one of the peaks above coroico .	1
the perfect hiding spot for terrorists , apparently .	1
who would ever guess that islamic terrorists would be lurking around coroico , adventure tourism capital ?	1
coroico , with its stunning scenery , picturesque small-town charm , thick with plantings of coffee beans and oranges ?	1
feeling rather sick , wara uncapped the bottle of luke-warm water paulo had given her last night and drained the rest .	1
she really needed to use the bathroom , but was n't about to ask .	1
yet .	1
right now she really needed a distraction , something to keep from thinking about muslim terrorists outside her tent and noah possibly being dead .	1
wara dropped the empty plastic bottle onto the sleeping bag and let her eyes wander around the tent .	1
the olive green tent was big enough for paulo to stand in at the center , just barely .	1
six people could possibly sleep in the thing side to side , but right now the tent only held the one sleeping bag , a rust-colored hiking backpack , the lantern , and leather sandals .	1
and a fat golden book .	1
swallowing hard , wara reached towards it , thinking maybe she could work on deciphering some of the arabic lettering in this quran to keep herself from crying .	1
she flipped through the gold leaf pages of the book , then frowned at the page and blinked .	1
because the book was n't a quran at all ; it was a bible .	1
the scrolling letters shimmered in front of her , and wara closed the book to see the cover , unable to believe what was in front of her eyes .	1
this guy , paulo , had a bible here in his tent ?	1
the same paulo who was holding her captive and had tried to kill her and noah on the bus ?	1
something fluttered out of the arabic bible pages , swishing to the nylon tent floor .	1
it was a dated-looking five-by-seven photograph of a happy family seated at a restaurant .	1
wara immediately recognized the bright colors and elephant logo of dumbo ice cream parlor in cochabamba .	1
the entire family in the picture was gathered around a square table with a canary yellow tablecloth , eating sundaes in tall , frosty glasses .	1
footsteps padded outside and wara jumped as paulo ducked in the tent .	1
he saw her sitting there , then paused .	1
droplets of water still clung to his temples and curly black hair .	1
`` how are you feeling ? ''	1
he finally said .	1
`` what ? ''	1
wara blinked at him .	1
how was she feeling ?	1
was she really supposed to be feeling anything other than awful ?	1
paulo 's eyes flitted between her face and the photo she was holding between two fingers .	1
it occurred to her that maybe snapping at him about how she was feeling would n't be the best way to keep this guy from killing her .	1
maybe she should talk to him , try to at least seem sympathetic .	1
it was n't very likely he would care , but worth a try .	1
`` dumbo , '' wara remarked , studying the picture again and trying to keep her voice from shaking .	1
`` i love this place .	1
i go here all the time in cochabamba .	1
who 's this in the picture ? ''	1
paulo lowered himself onto the floor next to her and held out one hand , palm up .	1
`` that 's my family , '' paulo said , obviously wanting the picture .	1
but wara kept staring at it , suddenly fascinated with how the family of an evil man who bombed buses would look .	1
they should be dysfunctional to the core , lounging together at a seedy bar while the kids ran wild in the streets .	1
what were they all doing eating ice cream at dumbo like decent people ?	1
two normal-appearing adults who could be the parents were both looking off in another direction , as were a few of the children .	1
`` looks like you have a nice family , '' wara said , thinking that it was actually true .	1
closest to the camera sat a plump teenage girl with curly ringlets , a mickey mouse sweatshirt , and huge gold hoop earrings .	1
a skinny , good-looking kid with dark hair had an arm around her , wearing a red soccer jersey , grinning at whoever was snapping the picture .	1
the shock started small , somewhere at the bottom of wara 's spine .	1
but by the time it raced up her back , she nearly choked , sucking in a horrified gasp .	1
`` please give me the picture , wara , '' paulo was saying with a tight smile , but wara had frozen , realizing that she knew the face of the girl with ringlets in the picture .	1
in fact , she knew that face so well she felt it was part of her own family .	1
paulo snatched the picture away and wara felt the tent wall shimmer around her in waves of hot and cold .	1
`` you 're alejandro martir ! ''	1
she croaked .	1
she stared at the face of the guy in front of her : square , coffee- colored jaw , pretty hazel eyes .	1
those were the eyes !	1
all seven of the martir kids had them , inherited from their mother , noly .	1
wara 's jaw dropped , then snapped back shut .	1
paulo was blinking at her , obviously shocked .	1
`` your sister , nazaret , '' she forced herself to say numbly , `` is my best friend in cochabamba . ''	1
paulo 's clear hazel eyes widened and then closed , very slowly .	1
his face confirmed everything .	1
13 olive green it ca n't be .	1
wara really could n't believe it , could n't wrap her mind around this being anything other than the worst nightmare ever .	1
`` you 're the brother ? ''	1
she forced herself to say the awful words out loud .	1
`` the one who 's been missing . ''	1
she could see it now , that faded photograph on nazaret 's white dresser , surrounded by threadbare teddy bears and little jeweled vials of nail polish .	1
it was him , that skinny kid from the missing brother picture .	1
he was the same guy sitting next to nazaret in the ice cream shop , arm slung around her shoulders .	1
and here with wara in this tent , holding her prisoner .	1
alejandro .	1
she could n't believe it .	1
one of the martirs was a criminal ?	1
or a muslim terrorist ?	1
paulo-no , alejandro -- -was looking at her with deliberation , as if deciding whether it was worth insisting on the previous lie about his identity .	1
then he erased his pained expression and scooted closer to her .	1
`` actually i go by alejo .	1
how is my sister ? ''	1
wara was furious , horrified .	1
`` why do n't you find out yourself ? ''	1
she snapped at him , voice bordering on hysterics .	1
`` your family has , like , adopted me in cochabamba .	1
they pray for you all the time .	1
they 've been wondering for years where you 've been ! ''	1
now wara was sputtering , and she tried to calm down .	1
her nerves were beyond frayed , and her hands trembled on her lap .	1
nazaret 's brother looked stricken , a marked change to his former aloofness .	1
`` nazaret has been doing really well , actually , '' wara glared at him .	1
`` until now , because she 's going to find out that two of her best friends are dead !	1
the good thing is , though , that it looks like she 'll never find out that her brother killed them .	1
so i 'm sure that someday , she 'll go back to being 'fine ' ! ''	1
tears filled wara 's eyes , and she felt furious for crying in front of this man .	1
but she was also afraid .	1
nazaret 's brother or not , this guy had kidnapped her and bombed the bus .	1
he had n't contacted his family in all these years .	1
the fact that wara knew the martirs was n't going to keep alejandro from killing her so she would n't give away information about whatever he and his fellow terrorists were doing .	1
it was n't the first time she 'd let that word float through her mind .	1
wara swiped at the tears with her sleeve and tried to control herself .	1
`` are you a terrorist ? ''	1
she asked warily , fixing her runny eyes on nazaret 's brother .	1
alejandro actually had the gall to draw back in surprise , screwing up his face as if offended by her insinuation .	1
`` what ?	1
no ! ''	1
he insisted , waving his hand at her .	1
`` we are not terrorists , ok ? ''	1
it could have been wara 's overactive imagination , but alejandro did not appear completely convinced of his own words .	1
brief memories crossed wara 's brain of various news articles she 'd read online recently , accusations from the united states that bolivia was harboring fundamental muslims and allowing them to use their country as a base for radical islam 's cause .	1
in fact , one of bolivia 's former presidents had foreseen something similar when he commented , `` bolivia is going to be the next afghanistan . ''	1
she remembered the web page noah had found that day in the coffee shop , the one about islam being the only hope for latin america .	1
`` i 'm not sure i believe you , alejandro , '' she said .	1
alejandro watched her guardedly .	1
`` actually i go by alejo .	1
i really hate alejandro .	1
that would be what my father called me . ''	1
what could alejandro martir possibly have against his father ?	1
pablo martir was a good man , a far cry from what his son had apparently become .	1
this was a nightmare .	1
wara 's eyes ran over alejo 's face again : nazaret 's father 's jaw .	1
his mother 's eyes .	1
it was awful .	1
being kidnapped and nearly killed by someone bearing the image of her bolivian `` parents '' was really freaking wara out .	1
she could n't handle it .	1
wara crumpled down into the sleeping bag and pulled the top over her head .	1
she squeezed her eyes shut , even after she heard alejo leave the tent , close the flap behind him .	1
alejo martir left her alone for a long time , just stopping back once to remind her that the tent was surrounded by motion detectors so she 'd better be sure not to escape .	1
he asked if she needed the bathroom or food , but she did n't even acknowledge him , still curled up under the sleeping bag .	1
alejo and the other guys were close by in the clearing , having some kind of meetings .	1
probably terrorist stuff .	1
maybe about noon he came back and caught her staring blankly at the cover of the fat golden bible `` brought you some granola bars , '' he said grimly .	1
`` and some more water .	1
but before you eat , there 's a stream close by in the forest .	1
i thought maybe you 'd want to go down there ... '' he squatted and picked up a bag from behind his backpack in the corner , which he held out towards wara .	1
she blinked , realizing it was her purple backpack .	1
`` how did that get here ?	1
i do n't remember . ''	1
alejo shrugged , one foot tapping on the floor , probably anxious to get back to whatever he was doing outside .	1
`` i 'm going to have gabriel and stalin take you down to the creek , '' he informed her .	1
noting a look of protest about to spread across her face , alejo raised one hand and said , `` most of the guys have already gone back home .	1
the ones that are left i trust .	1
they 're going to take you there and bring you right back .	1
ok ? ''	1
`` fine . ''	1
wara shrugged helplessly .	1
what choice did she have ?	1
she was his prisoner , right ?	1
`` thanks for the food , '' she said in a small voice , glad right now for any small kindness .	1
alejo nodded curtly and eyed her again before turning to stride out of the tent .	1
she heard him giving instructions to someone outside , and then the tent flap pulled aside and two faces poked in : the pale goatee who woke alejo for prayers this morning and the pudgy guy who last night had told her that when she kicked the bucket she deserved to go to heaven .	1
`` ready ? ''	1
they asked politely .	1
wara stood up warily , racking her brain to try to remember if these two had been among those making nasty comments upon her arrival last night .	1
as far as she could recall , the stringy-haired guy had only been standing and staring-and she remembered him giving her a hand up and telling the guys to stop with the lewd jokes .	1
and the skinny guy-now it was all coming back .	1
he had leaned close when alejo had his arm practically around her neck and whispered , `` i did n't want to bring her , but the guys said i had to . ''	1
so far so good .	1
`` ok , sure . ''	1
wara shrugged and tried to pick up her rather heavy backpack .	1
the bulky guy stepped forward hesitantly and held out one arm for her bag .	1
she handed it to him without a word and followed the two of them outside .	1
after a few steps in blinding sunlight , they entered the shade of the trees .	1
a chorus of cicadas and tropical birds was rising above the canopy .	1
wara jumped as a reedy voice said , `` so , i 'm stalin .	1
in coroico i 'm a professor .	1
i teach kids morality and ethics class . ''	1
`` uh , hi . ''	1
morality and ethics class ?	1
is he serious ?	1
`` my name is gabriel shara . ''	1
wara noticed that the taller , thin guy had a baby face with kind-looking greenish eyes .	1
`` i 'm wara cadogan , '' she said , wondering if they really cared .	1
`` yeah , we know . ''	1
gabriel was starting to cheer up .	1
`` we read your passport .	1
you 've been here in bolivia for a really long time . ''	1
`` six years , '' stalin remarked , stepping carefully over a very tall rock , slippery with the morning dew .	1
wara felt the dampness soak through her canvas shoes and into her ankle socks , and decided that whatever time left to her in life she would live barefoot .	1
`` just a second , '' she said , stopping in the middle of the forest and beginning to peel off her soaked shoes and socks .	1
`` my shoes are all wet . ''	1
`` but-we 're almost to the stream ! ''	1
stalin insisted , seemingly shocked by the sight of a gringa stripping off her footwear in the middle of the cloud forest .	1
`` you 're going to get cut on the rocks ! ''	1
`` well apparently i might die today anyway , so i might as well enjoy my last day , right ?	1
am i supposed to be afraid of dying with a few cuts on my feet ? ''	1
she wadded the damp socks up into her shoes and began walking again , picking her way over broken sticks and squishy moss .	1
stalin and gabriel walked alongside her in morose silence , until the gurgling of water told wara that stalin had been right .	1
a shallow , rushing stream cut its way through a dirt patch of the forest just ahead , tripping over small stones in its path .	1
stalin set her backpack down on a flat rock by the stream , and then motioned to gabriel .	1
`` ok , so we 're going to leave you here for a while , but do n't do anything foolish because we 'll be close by . ''	1
stalin cocked his head to one side and then said , `` we wo n't be peeking , though .	1
i mean , we 'll be far enough away ? ''	1
gabriel looked mortified and glared at stalin , who grinned lopsidedly and let gabriel lead him away .	1
gabriel turned back towards her with a cool grin .	1
`` do n't even think about disappearing , ok ?	1
i 've got equipment up here you 've never even heard of , and i 'll find you like that . ''	1
he snapped his long fingers , and then whirled back to continue off to some point in the banana plants where they would be waiting .	1
shivering in the coolness of the mountain air , wara quickly unzipped her backpack and dug out a change of clothes .	1
she pulled on black pants and a green tank top , then knelt next to the stream to try to wash the dried blood from her cheek and hair .	1
`` still there ? ''	1
a masculine voice hollered from somewhere in the bushes .	1
`` yes ! ''	1
she answered , biting her lip .	1
`` just a second , ok ? ''	1
`` just making sure ! ''	1
a different voice called back .	1
the frigid water burned her scalp and she realized she probably did have some cuts .	1
she remembered the side of her head smacking against something in the bus as she saw the wall of silver fire go spinning over her like a ceiling .	1
i must have gotten thrown out the window , she realized with a shiver .	1
but i hardly have any cuts .	1
maybe the explosion blew the glass away first .	1
nausea filled her as she imagined noah , arm ripped away from her shoulder as he was thrown further into the fiery bus by the explosion , while she was tossed out the window in the opposite direction , to safety .	1
`` i know women take a long time , but we really have to get back . ''	1
wara thought the too-cheerful voice was skinny gabriel 's .	1
she slogged across the spiky grass on her bare feet and scooped up her backpack .	1
`` ok , you can take me back now , '' she called sadly .	1
in a way , she wished they would just tie her up out here instead of bringing her back to the clearing .	1
here , sapphire blue butterflies were flitting across the racing surface of the stream , licking up crystal drops , dipping their spindly black legs into the water .	1
stalin and gabriel crunched their way out of the foliage , staring at her standing there in bare feet .	1
obviously deciding not to mention the feet again , stalin wordlessly took her backpack and motioned for her to follow them back to the camp .	1
sunshine hit her damp hair with a welcome warmth as she stepped out of the shade and into the clearing .	1
the sight of all the olive green tents quickly brought the chill back .	1
alejo was sitting on a rock , talking to a short guy with wire rim glasses and a little brown goatee .	1
`` take care of things for me a while , will you benjamin ? ''	1
alejo told him and wara was not happy with the way alejo 's eyes ran over her as stalin and gabriel passed her over to him .	1
alejo 's lips curved into a wry smile and he grabbed her arm , half-dragging her with him towards his tent .	1
she really had to focus on keeping her feet under her as alejo marched her along , then pushed her through the door of the tent .	1
inside , her dropped her arm and latched the tent door shut .	1
`` bad news , '' alejo frowned at her , then immediately began to pace .	1
wara blinked , noticing the bead of sweat that had popped out on his forehead just then .	1
what was going on ?	1
she started to ask , but alejo held up a hand to cut her off .	1
`` let me think , '' he ordered crossly .	1
wara bit her lip and sank down onto the sleeping back , hooking her hands around her raised knees .	1
a few loud shouts rang out in the clearing , and alejo muttered a very bad word .	1
animated conversation drew nearer outside the tent .	1
`` you did n't have to come back here , sir , '' someone said cheerfully .	1
`` we have everything under control-no worries . ''	1
a pause while a lower voice rumbled something .	1
then , `` yeah , she 's in there .	1
alejo 's been keeping her .	1
of course we understand that .	1
he just wanted to wait until the paraguayans were gone , not make a show of it . ''	1
alejo swore , glanced at the tightly-closed tent door , and then swore again .	1
he pressed one hand against his temple , and then fixed his eyes on wara , taking a deep breath .	1
`` i hope you can forgive me for this , '' he muttered , then swung down to yank her to her feet , pulling her against his chest .	1
panicked , wara tried to pull away , but alejo 's fingers dug into both of her wrists .	1
when he let go , she could n't bring her arms around from behind her back .	1
something thin and biting dug into her flesh , pricking her hands .	1
alejo had bound her wrists together .	1
she barely had time to register this fact before alejo threw an arm around her and dragged her tighter against his chest .	1
her rib cage slammed into his and he hooked a leg around the back of hers , preventing her escape .	1
before she knew it , he was kissing her , the scarce stubble of his chin like sandpaper against her cheek .	1
appalled , wara struggled against him , trying to free one of her legs to kick him hard .	1
it was no use ; she was caught like a worm on a hook .	1
heavy footsteps sounded outside , and sunlight flooded the tent as someone flapped open the door .	1
alejo took his time finishing the kiss , then finally let wara draw back and turn towards the door .	1
her vision swam as she took in the familiar figures of stalin and gabriel , along with two new faces watching them from just inside the tent .	1
a shower of sparks shot through her skull as alejo grabbed her hair and tilted her face upward towards his .	1
his eyes were glinting with a thousand specks of green fire , and she felt her face burn , absolutely humiliated .	1
alejo winked at her , then turned towards the guys at the door .	1
`` what is it ? ''	1
he grinned .	1
`` we 're a little busy right now .	1
i told the guys i 'd be right back , ishmael . ''	1
wara shivered at his mocking tone .	1
alejo released her hair and she turned to see the newcomers , face still flaming .	1
standing next to stalin stood a tanned figure , jaw hanging open as he gaped at her and alejo .	1
it was lzaro .	1
14 beet red sharp purple stars exploeded in front of wara 's eyes .	1
this could not be happening .	1
`` lzaro ? ''	1
she struggled to push away from alejo , all the while unable to take her gaze off lzaro in the doorway .	1
he was wearing the same kind of irish cap he had always worn , along with a casual sweater , jeans , and hiking boots .	1
his eyes were hidden behind the same sunglasses he had been wearing in the truck in coroico .	1
wara gasped loudly .	1
lzaro ripped the sunglasses from his eyes and gaped at alejo .	1
`` wara ? ''	1
lzaro said dumbly , gaze dashing back and forth between wara and alejo .	1
`` you 're the one they found ? ? ''	1
wara 's eyes were torn away from lzaro as alejo 's hand forced her head against his chest .	1
she tried to pull away angrily , then froze , weak-kneed , as she heard him unsheathe the hunting knife from his belt and saw its blade out of the corner of her eye .	1
remembering her position as captive , wara let herself hang limply against alejo as one of his hands continued digging into her cheek .	1
with the other , he pulled at the plastic ties around her wrists and cut her hands free .	1
through his t-shirt , wara could hear the steady , slow tempo of alejo 's heart , totally composed , completely devoid of the fear that caused her own heart to race .	1
she hated him for it .	1
by now , the bridge of lzaro 's nose had turned beet red , and his fists clenched at his sides .	1
`` that 's my girlfriend , you idiot ! ''	1
he growled .	1
alejo started with surprise and a moment of silence rang over the tent .	1
`` your ex-girlfriend , is n't it ? ''	1
he finally said coolly .	1
`` this is the missionary you used to go out with ?	1
well you should thank me then for doing you a favor .	1
her boyfriend is dead , along with salazar .	1
do n't get your knickers all up in a knot .	1
c'mon , let 's take this outside ! ''	1
alejo 's fingers dug into her arm as he dragged her through the tent door .	1
the others drew back to make room .	1
lzaro , apparently not satisfied in the least with alejo 's calm explanation , swore foully and then rushed him , slamming into him from behind .	1
wara felt the momentum of the push twisting her off her feet .	1
an arm caught her around the shoulders , yanking her back up to standing as alejo released her .	1
she saw alejo land on both palms just before hitting the ground and release a lightening backwards kick that caught lzaro under the chin , spinning him around with a grunt .	1
wara struggled to look behind her and realized that the man now holding her was benjamin , the one with the wire-rim glasses .	1
one forearm clamped tightly around her neck , threatening to cut off her airway if she moved .	1
wara was trapped , watching as lzaro and alejo flew at each other again in some kind of martial arts stance , each taking a few violent punches .	1
like alejo had said earlier , most of the guys who had been up here on the mountain were already gone .	1
an older guy wara had n't seen before had appeared , however , watching the scene with displeasure , arms crossed in front of his chest .	1
the man was actually much older than the others , wearing olive green pants with multiple pockets , a t-shirt , and one of those khaki vests full of zippers and flaps favored by foreign journalists in a war zone .	1
a neatly-trimmed beard peppered with gray gave the impression that he could be a kindly grandfather , except for how his eyebrows were now knit into the perfect v , scowling first at her , then at the fight .	1
confused and numb by all the blows and shouts , wara 's mind finally registered that alejo had launched himself from the ground with a somersault and brutally knocked lzaro to the dirt with a kick to the ribs .	1
spinning in a half circle , lzaro fell with a thud , swore at the attempt to rise , then gave up .	1
`` enough ? ''	1
alejo panted , sweat running down his back .	1
`` i like you , che , and i really hope that 's enough .	1
i did n't know , i promise you .	1
just for you , i wo n't touch her again . ''	1
`` yes , i think fun time is over . ''	1
the authoritative voice of the grandfatherly newcomer carried over the group .	1
`` asalaam alaikum , ishmael . ''	1
wara saw alejo grin at the older man .	1
then nazaret 's brother began speaking a different language , clipped , as if reporting facts .	1
lzaro was painfully picking himself up off the ground , a bloody gash running above his right eyebrow .	1
he walked gingerly towards the rest of the group , keeping a wary distance from alejo , listening .	1
from time to time he threw a guarded glance at wara .	1
soon after their little conference , the older guy turned his beady gaze back on wara .	1
she was still pinned against benjamin , eyes barely slit open , for the first time ever not trying to figure out what language everyone was speaking .	1
sweat dripped down her back and she was terrified .	1
`` i am so sorry , '' the older guy was saying with a smile in smooth spanish , `` that this has been allowed to drag on this long .	1
i 'm sure you are a nice girl. ``	1
the smile died away , and he unsheathed a long , curved hunting knife with a smooth whine , turning his gaze towards lzaro .	1
`` my son , it 's time for us to move on , '' he explained patiently to lzaro in accented spanish .	1
`` apart from being a witness to the bus accident , she can identify you . ''	1
a trickle of blood from the wound alejo left was slowly winding down lzaro 's face like a shiny maroon caterpillar .	1
he gaped dumbly at the knife that the man now extended towards him `` lzaro , '' wara stammered , heart slamming against benjamin 's arm .	1
the fact that lzaro , too , was here , part of this , was absolutely surreal .	1
`` how could you do this ?	1
noah was your friend , was n't he ?	1
how could you want to kill him ?	1
he never did anything to you ! ``	1
lzaro just stared at her , possibly realizing for the first time that noah too had been on the bus .	1
he glanced at the old guy , nervously , and his hand closest to the offered knife twitched .	1
wara took in that gabriel , standing next to lzaro , appeared ready to vomit , one hand clutching his throat , staring at wara 's neck .	1
feeling faint , wara realized that they were going to slit her throat .	1
lzaro stumbled a slight step back , and at that moment wara saw the flash of the knife against the sun as the old guy moved straight towards her , impatient .	1
she felt benjamin 's grip on her tighten as he said , `` i 've got her , mr .	1
khan . ''	1
and then , from the side , alejo was moving forward , marching towards her with a face full of calm fury .	1
the fist that connected with her face shot white hot rays of pain through her head , splattering her vision with colored lights .	1
benjamin must have released her just as alejo 's punch slammed into her nose .	1
wara twisted around backwards on lifeless knees , then crumpled to the ground with a jolt of fire .	1
evil lights flashed in front of her eyes , and she wanted to pass out , die , anything .	1
no such luck .	1
wara shrieked in agony as someone grabbed her hair and pulled her to her feet , wrapping an arm around her shoulders to secure her against them because it was obvious that there was no way she could stand .	1
oh god , please help !	1
get me through this part ?	1
`` stand up ! ''	1
a voice grated into her ear , and wara 's heart sank as she realized it was alejo she heard herself breathing loudly , vision swimming with the pain .	1
alejo yanked her hair back and wara saw the silver of a razor-sharp knife blade , only an inch away from her exposed neck .	1
`` we have extenuating circumstances here , sir , '' she heard alejo say calmly .	1
`` gabriel should n't have to watch this .	1
i 'll take her into the forest . ''	1
he dragged her in front of him so her bare feet skimmed the grass , then barked into her ear , `` walk ! ''	1
to the other men he called , `` we 'll meet in town ! ''	1
alejo pushed her ahead of him into the cover of the mossy forest , dragging wara along as he stomped through the grass .	1
her vision had cleared enough to make out the trees , but everything still shimmered and she was sure if alejo were n't holding her up she would have just dropped to the ground .	1
she absently realized the salty stuff dripping across her lips was blood and that her nose was probably broken .	1
may nazaret never hear about this , about what her brother has done .	1
they pushed quite a ways into the forest , ducking under hanging tree fronds and circling giant banana plants .	1
then wara 's foot hooked on a big root and she went hurdling towards the forest floor .	1
the vision of the flashing knife waving near her neck told her alejo was going down with her .	1
wara 's breath pumped out of her chest with a sharp gasp as his body slammed on top of hers , pushing her face into the raspy grass .	1
a rough hand clamped across her mouth , sending rays of pains surging though her skull .	1
`` do n't scream , '' he whispered lowly in her ear .	1
`` whatever you do , do n't scream .	1
i 'm not going to hurt you . ''	1
breathing heavily , alejo rolled off of wara and sat listlessly on the ground by her side , one arm propped up on his knee .	1
in a daze , wara rolled over onto her back painfully , unable to stop shaking .	1
her eyes were beginning to swell .	1
she gingerly wiped her sleeve across her face in an attempt to clear away some of the blood that was still flowing from her nose and stifled a sob at how much it hurt .	1
god , what is happening ?	1
`` you 're going to kill me later , then ? ''	1
even though alejo had told her to be quiet , she had to know .	1
he had been staring off into the jungle , but now his gaze jerked sharply back to her .	1
wara winced and raised her arm , cringing .	1
he did n't hit her again , and she opened her eyes in time to see alejo hurl the knife off into the forest as if it were a deadly scorpion .	1
he turned away from her and threw up onto the prickly tropical grass , gasped for breath , and then threw up again .	1
finally he lifted his head , white as a sheet , and wiped his mouth shakily on his sleeve .	1
`` i 'm so sorry , '' he choked .	1
`` i told you i was n't going to hurt you .	1
oh god , i 'm so sorry .	1
nothing 's going to happen to you now , ok .	1
i 'm gon na take you where it 's safe . ''	1
wara started to feel everything around her fading away .	1
maybe she was dying .	1
the giant pine tree branches overhead were starting to sway as if a lazy breeze ran through them .	1
no , that was ridiculous .	1
she could n't be dying from a broken nose .	1
but she felt so dizzy , and simply could n't move .	1
what was nazaret 's brother saying ?	1
that he was sorry he had broken her nose ?	1
why ?	1
he had n't looked sorry a few minutes ago when he did it .	1
and what was with the puking ?	1
everything is spinning around so fast .	1
wara vaguely realized that she had been scooped up and was moving through the trees .	1
alejo must be carrying her .	1
she slumped against his shoulder , and the sounds of crickets singing among the banana trees and grass crunching underfoot slowly faded away .	1
15 pale she felt herself gently swaying back and forth , face hugging something scratchy and warm .	1
for several minutes she drifted blissfully between semi-awake and half-asleep , trying to pry her eyes open but at the same time being quite sure she did not want to wake up .	1
she remembered passing out , and that alejo had hit her , and yeah , the pain was definitely still there .	1
wara gasped and jerked wide awake , rolling into a sitting position and looking over her shoulder .	1
he was still here , sitting with arms propped on his knees .	1
wara grabbed her head as black and silver flashed across her eyes in a violent parade .	1
the sunlight was blinding .	1
they were in the back of a truck , surrounded by high wooden slats .	1
alejo was staring off to one side , watching the road through gaps between the rough boards .	1
he turned towards her when he heard her groan , but wara could only close her eyes and take deep breaths , trying to keep the world from spinning around backwards .	1
freakily , alejo 's expression had completely changed from the way he had looked at her with remorse in the jungle for those few minutes after he had thrown the knife away into the wild .	1
now , his face had settled into such a serious mask that wara was glad she was too dizzy to look at him .	1
those intense hazel eyes were just plain scary .	1
she moaned again and weakly flopped back into a fetal position in the straw of the floor of the truck , her back to nazaret 's brother .	1
he had given her a concussion ; she was sure of it .	1
against her closed eyes , she saw again the scene in the clearing of the camp , alejo 's face as he swung at her in rage .	1
the rest of the blank faces as they simply stared .	1
`` why did n't you kill me ? ''	1
wara barely recognized the croaking voice that came out of her own mouth .	1
she cleared her throat slowly and curled up tighter in her corner of the truck bed , too weak to do anything else but wait for his answer .	1
after a long pause , alejo answered her , voice detached but non-threatening .	1
`` i never wanted to kill you .	1
i just could n't let you know that , or you would have given away the escape plan . ''	1
`` what ? ''	1
wara squeaked .	1
`` my friends are very smart .	1
they would have been able to tell if you trusted me .	1
i never meant to have to hit you '' -- his voice faltered for a second there- '' but it was the only way to get you out of there with what i had to work with .	1
i was in charge of the rest there at the camp .	1
but that man who showed up with lzaro is ishmael khan , our handler .	1
he 's our boss , and as soon as he arrived , i knew that you were as good as dead . ''	1
wara frowned as alejo went on .	1
`` ishmael was already coming at you with the knife , because lzaro would n't do it .	1
i had to stop him cold in his tracks , and hitting you was the only way i could think of .	1
two more seconds and he would have cut your throat .	1
gabriel was robbed and had his throat slit in pakistan a month ago , and lzaro was involved with you , so i had a good excuse to take you out of their sight and eliminate you .	1
they could n't have handled it .	1
and because you were ? incapacitated , benjamin and the khan assumed they did n't need to come with me to keep you from escaping .	1
thank god they did n't . ''	1
there was a long pause as wara tried to focus on the details of what alejo had just said .	1
he had to break her nose to save her life ?	1
`` you broke my nose ! ''	1
she blurted out , then gasped at the nausea waves produced by the effort of shouting .	1
`` i wo n't be able to tell if your nose if broken until the swelling goes down , '' alejo said , still maddeningly calm .	1
`` if it 's broken , i can set it .	1
i 've set a lot of broken noses , including mine . ''	1
there was no way she was letting alejo touch her swollen nose .	1
she dared to raise a hand to her face and realized that there was n't nearly as much dried blood as she remembered .	1
had alejo cleaned blood from her face while she was sleeping ?	1
the thought made her frown .	1
she just lay there , slumped into the straw , not knowing what exactly she was allowed to ask in the presence of a terrorist who was also the brother of her best friend .	1
how did she address the man who had broken her nose and then saved her life ?	1
wara found she did n't care anymore ; everything had become much too confusing .	1
`` so , who are you ? ''	1
she finally asked , slowly working her way over onto her back .	1
a painful blush spread across her face as the memory of alejo kissing her in the tent played across her mind .	1
she supposed it was part of his lovely escape plan , but she still did n't like thinking about it at all .	1
`` you have a handler ?	1
are you , like , a hit man ? ''	1
sitting cross-legged next to her , alejo snorted , a frustrated , annoyed kind of sound .	1
`` no , i 'm not a 'hit man ' !	1
i work for a muslim organization that works for justice by fighting against the bad guys , wara . ''	1
`` but you have a bible .	1
a really big one .	1
do you even read that thing ? ''	1
of course he did n't read it .	1
he was a muslim .	1
and a murderer .	1
we fight against the bad guys , wara , alejo had said .	1
well , wara was pretty sure nazaret 's brother was confused about the definition of `` bad guy . ''	1
alejo sighed and pressed his lips together .	1
`` i 'm not a muslim anymore , '' he finally said .	1
wara glanced at him , blinking away the confusion .	1
alejo looked away at the wooden truck slats .	1
`` i was , but now i 've decided to follow jesus '' wara did n't think she could have been more shocked if he had proposed marriage right then and there .	1
this guy was a nutcase !	1
`` how can you follow jesus and ? go around killing people ? ''	1
she demanded .	1
she tried to scoff , but the effort just hurt her nose .	1
she settled for scowling at him .	1
alejo turned towards her sharply .	1
`` we do n't just go around killing people .	1
i have high-level training from hezbollah 's militant wing , and i take advantage of that to get rid of the guys who hurt the poor and oppressed .	1
i do things that i know are wrong , but it 's worse , wara , to just sit around and do nothing while you watch innocent people suffer .	1
we 're not terrorists . ''	1
wara was n't convinced .	1
`` so you follow jesus by killing people . ''	1
alejo cut her off .	1
`` a couple weeks ago , my good friend gabriel was robbed and they slit his throat .	1
a few seconds later , a pakistani man came along and found him lying there .	1
he could have just left him alone-it was really inconvenient for him to help .	1
but he did help him and he saved gabriel 's life , like in the story jesus told about the samaritan . ''	1
alejo played absently with the fringe on a canvas bag of oranges that was part of the truck 's cargo .	1
`` what if that pakistani guy had come along while gabriel was still being attacked ?	1
should he , or the good samaritan , have just politely stepped aside and waited until the thieves finished , before stepping up to see if the victim was still alive and they could help ?	1
or if they were stronger than the thieves and had a gun , should they have saved the man from being robbed and nearly killed in the first place ? ''	1
wara frowned , remembering gabriel with the friendly green eyes who had taken her down to the creek and how he had one hand to his throat as he watched them about to kill wara .	1
`` jesus said to love your enemies , '' she finally managed .	1
no matter how much using violence seemed to be justified , the results could never be worth it , could they ?	1
what about noah ?	1
`` i know . ''	1
alejo was still frowning darkly .	1
`` but he also said he came to set the captives free , and to show love to everyone .	1
as horrible as it is , sometimes those two commands just ca n't both happen at the same time . ''	1
alejo was morosely silent for a moment , and wara squinted up into the streaked sky .	1
they were driving under the leafy branches of clustered palm trees now , and the sunlight flashed onto her face , then disappeared behind the temporary shade of their latticed leaves .	1
he could have killed me , but instead he saved my life , wara realized .	1
she would like to think alejo was just insane , but some of what he said made sense .	1
she just lay there , squinting against the bright sky , trying not to think about how much everything hurt .	1
`` what about you ? ''	1
she finally asked to break the unpleasant silence .	1
`` you were in charge .	1
are n't you going to get in big trouble for this ? ''	1
she tried to meet his eyes , hoping he would see that she was grateful , despite the possible broken nose , several unwanted kisses , and the fact that he was the one who had nearly killed her on the bus in the first place .	1
but wara found alejo staring off at the pile of blue canvas orange sacks , looking much more serious than she had hoped .	1
`` actually we are in big trouble , '' he answered a little mechanically , eyes not meeting hers .	1
`` i 'm going to keep you safe , i swear it .	1
but first there 's something i have to do .	1
i think that ? i 'm pretty sure that ?	1
`` alejo stopped and swallowed hard .	1
`` in punishment for me betraying the group , i think they 're going to try to kill my family . ''	1
wara suddenly could n't breathe .	1
`` what ? ''	1
she croaked .	1
a wave of ice engulfed her .	1
his family .	1
the martirs .	1
`` i know they 're going to look for them . ''	1
alejo shook his head bitterly .	1
`` i was a leader ; i know everything .	1
there 's no way the khan is n't going to be furious .	1
he saw me as family and i betrayed him . ''	1
`` nazaret ? ''	1
wara whispered .	1
a shiver ran from her toes to her scalp .	1
`` they would hurt them ?	1
what are we going to do ? ''	1
`` if we can warn them first , they can run . ''	1
alejo 's voice was flat and a sheen of sweat painted his forehead .	1
wara was horrified .	1
`` but ? how much time do we have ? ''	1
`` when you heard us talking in pashto , ishmael was telling us to kill you right away and throw your body in the waterfall that 's about a half-hour walk into the forest .	1
the body would have drifted down into the main river , which runs through the canyon near the bus ? accident .	1
i told them i 'd meet them down in coroico .	1
i say we have two more hours before they start to wonder , three before they realize what i 've done . ''	1
alejo rested his arms on his knees and hid his face .	1
`` oh god , '' wara heard him whisper raggedly , shoulders slumped with despair .	1
`` what have i done ? ''	1
16 canary yellow `` bajamos ! ''	1
alejo 's no-nonsense voice boomed as he banged on the side of the truck through the slats a few minutes later .	1
whoever was driving must have heard his announcement that the people in the back wanted off , because the truck 's gears shifted down and the heavy vehicle scraped to a stop .	1
wara 's head hurt even more now , thanks to the shocking news about the martirs .	1
the rusty back gate of the truck clanged open revealing a young guy with a che guevara baseball hat and greasy black ponytail waiting for them to get out .	1
alejo hauled wara to her feet , and for a moment everything shimmered violet and green .	1
her legs were n't feeling so weak anymore , and she took a few shaky steps across the filthy truck bed , avoiding the giant sacks stuffed full of tropical fruit .	1
alejo passed the driver a red hundred boliviano note , then lowered wara onto the ground and jumped out behind her .	1
wara heard the truck grind into gear and chug away behind them .	1
`` i can walk now . ''	1
wara realized alejo 's arm was around her waist .	1
she shrugged away from him and began to pick her way carefully through the tangled mass of plants .	1
`` ya , '' alejo said .	1
the spanish equivalent of `` fine . ''	1
wara glanced at him and saw he was still sweating bullets , the weight of the world on his shoulders .	1
could it really be possible that his family could die because he had become part of this group ?	1
she wrinkled her nose painfully .	1
`` where are we going now ? ''	1
she whispered , not sure if there might be bad guys lurking about in the wild .	1
alejo seemed startled by her sudden question , but he did n't slow his stride .	1
`` there 's an airplane here .	1
we can take it to get to cochabamba and warn my family . ''	1
wara struggled not to stumble at the reminder that someone could hurt the martirs .	1
`` is there a pilot ? ''	1
`` i can fly it . ''	1
alejo 's answer was clipped but not impatient .	1
wara frowned and shifted her gaze over to him , not sure what to think .	1
alejo apparently read her thoughts because his mouth twisted wryly and he said , `` i fly the plane for work , wara .	1
this is the only airplane that brings tourists in and out of coroico , so we make good money .	1
it 's not because i 'm plotting to fly the thing into a building like 9/11 . ''	1
before she could answer him , they came into a little clearing holding a squatty adobe house half-shaded by a thick mass of arching orange trees .	1
a battered blue motorcycle leaned against a sleek banana plant , and a gaggle of scraggly chickens pecked lazily in the powdery dirt .	1
there appeared to be a larger clearing beyond the house , and sure enough , a straw-colored airplane was sheltered under a structure made of corrugated tin sheets .	1
and in the distance , a spacious , cleared area with dirt tracks down the center : a runway .	1
alejo hollered out a greeting in spanish and a stout , balding guy wearing a stained white undershirt swaggered out from behind a sheet fluttering over the house 's open door .	1
`` alejo ! ''	1
the man 's ample face instantly spread into a grin .	1
he covered the distance between himself and his visitors quickly , clasping alejo 's hand firmly in his own beefy one .	1
there was a tattoo of a mermaid with red scales and a set of panpipes on his upper arm .	1
wara knew she should be wondering who this guy was , but thinking about the martirs made her feel dizzy .	1
her face still hurt .	1
a lot .	1
`` che , how 's it goin ' ? ''	1
the guy with the mermaid tattoo slapped alejo on the shoulder .	1
`` you gon na take helda up ? ''	1
he turned to greet the girl at alejo 's side but stopped short of the kiss on the cheek when he saw the condition of wara 's face .	1
the balding man took her hand carefully instead and held it , frowning back at alejo in concern .	1
`` che , what have you been doing to this woman ?	1
i hope it was n't you , eh ? ''	1
he was trying to joke , but the alarm in the guy 's eyes said he suspected it was indeed alejo who was responsible for the condition of wara 's nose .	1
she suddenly felt ashamed , standing there with bare , filthy feet and dried blood caked on her tank top .	1
alejo laid a hand on her shoulder , and she cringed , stepping away .	1
`` boris , i 'm taking her to the doctor . ''	1
alejo saw her glaring at him and smiled tightly .	1
`` since i 'm going into cochabamba anyway on business . ''	1
`` well , good . ''	1
the fat , mermaid tattoo guy named boris nodded , shooting another worried glance at wara .	1
`` do n't forget .	1
you 'll bring me back helda tomorrow ?	1
maybe bring some tourists back ? ''	1
`` sure , if we 're lucky .	1
but now i 've got ta fly like a bat outta hell .	1
do you think we could get her up in five minutes ? ''	1
`` why not ? ''	1
boris shrugged and his belly jiggled under the white undershirt .	1
`` on the way back we can have a beer .	1
i wo n't tell the khan .	1
just sign the log please , and i 'll get her ready . ''	1
boris winked and pulled a tattered notebook sporting the fading image of the incredible hulk out of his back pocket .	1
alejo pulled the lid off a ballpoint pen with his teeth , scribbled something in the notebook , and flipped the pen and notebook back towards boris .	1
the portly airplane owner whipped around with amazing agility and started towards the airplane , shouting instructions into a small black radio he had somehow produced and now held up to his mouth .	1
`` boris ! ''	1
alejo yelled after him .	1
boris turned around distractedly as he dictated what appeared to be flight coordinates to someone across the radio waves .	1
`` let your daughter lend some clothes to this poor girl . ''	1
wara wanted to sink into the ground as alejo motioned towards her with a sheepish grin .	1
`` c'mon !	1
i 'll bring her something new back from the market in cochabamba when i come . ''	1
boris must have nodded his approval , because wara heard alejo holler `` gracias '' , then motioned her forward towards the ramshackle house .	1
he yanked the blue-checked sheet draped over the doorway aside so wara could enter the house .	1
she clenched her fists as she squeezed past alejo 's sweat-soaked t-shirt .	1
the room just inside the door was cramped , graced with a burnt orange couch with torn upholstery and a few armchairs .	1
an antique wooden shelf holding a murky fish tank and an army of porcelain clowns and teddy bears was stuffed in a corner .	1
with the low glass coffee table in the middle of the room there was barely space to turn around .	1
a wicker ceiling fan swirled above , lop-sided and losing the battle to cool the room from the tropical heat .	1
a chubby teenage girl with deep red lip liner and a black brittany spears tank top with rhinestones stuck her head out of the doorway of one of the back rooms .	1
`` hey , alexis , '' alejo greeted the girl .	1
`` what 's up ?	1
say , your dad said i could ask you a big favor .	1
my friend here would like to borrow some of your clothes .	1
i told your dad i 'd bring you something new back from the market in cochabamba . ''	1
alexis kissed alejo on the cheek but looked skeptical about his offer .	1
she raised one plucked eyebrow and took in wara 's bloody face and disgusting appearance .	1
`` my dad said that ? ''	1
wara squared her jaw , determined to get through this , to get to the martirs and make sure they were safe .	1
alejo tried his most convincing smile .	1
`` c'mon , i bet i 've got good taste . ''	1
`` fine , no problem , alejo . ''	1
alexis shook her head and rolled her eyes .	1
she took one last glance at wara but did n't seem to be concerned as she sauntered into the back room .	1
apparently boris ' little adobe house was the kind of place bloodied strangers could show up and no one would blink an eye .	1
wara was feeling weak again and wished she could sink down into the faded orange sofa .	1
a sudden thought halted her midstride towards the couch .	1
`` i know the numbers of all your family 's cell phones .	1
we can call them .	1
good old alexis must have a phone we can use , right ? ''	1
`` nope , '' alejo shook his head firmly .	1
`` i 'm not about to use the cell phones here -- -could be tracked afterwards .	1
my sat phone stayed with stalin , since he had it on him when i went into the tent to ? talk with you right before the khan showed up . ''	1
`` what about internet ? ''	1
wara was feeling desperate , like she was trying to run through quicksand , not able to move a single step forward .	1
there had to be some way to warn nazaret 's family , before alejo and wara could make it to cochabamba in the plane outside .	1
`` yeah , there 's internet . ''	1
`` well , i can catch your sister on facebook .	1
she 's online like all the time .	1
she 's got to be online right now . ''	1
`` my sister still uses that ?	1
are n't there social networking pages that are a little more ? modern ? ''	1
`` yeah , well .	1
some of us still use it . ''	1
alejo led wara into the first side room , where , sure enough , there was a very sleek , cobalt-colored computer sitting atop a battered bamboo desk .	1
`` do n't we have to ask ? ''	1
wara looked up at him .	1
alejo was opening a little black fridge in the corner of the office .	1
he pulled out a bottle of very cold water , twisted off the lid and handed it to wara .	1
`` here .	1
drink this .	1
nope , me and my friends kind of half live here . ''	1
alejo was already flipping on switches and in a few seconds wara was sitting before a picture of alexis in a canary yellow bikini , along with several swarthy teenage boys , next to one of the cascading waterfalls just outside of coroico .	1
nice .	1
she gulped half the water bottle , then signed into facebook while alejo drank the rest .	1
`` yes !	1
i knew it ! ''	1
she hissed triumphantly .	1
the little green icon blinked back at her , telling her nazaret was signed in , as usual .	1
that girl was always on facebook .	1
alexis came in , winked at alejo and tried to strike a sultry pose .	1
`` bring me a pair of really tight jeans , ok alejo ?	1
you 'd better take a good look so you can remember my size . ''	1
she unceremoniously dumped a pile of clothes on the desk , posed again , then scoffed and stalked away when alejo did n't even look at her .	1
wara was typing furiously .	1
`` nazaret , are you there ? ?	1
please , let me know if you are there , quickly .	1
it 's urgente ! ''	1
ten eternal seconds passed , and then the reply message blinked , `` wara ? ? ?	1
are you ok ? ''	1
by now , nazaret must have heard about the accident .	1
eduardo and the australians must have told the martirs that she and noah had been on the bus .	1
but there was no time for beating around the bush .	1
`` i 'm ok. you could never guess who is here with me right now .	1
i am here with your brother .	1
alejandro . ''	1
more time clicked by , and wara could n't even begin to imagine the look on her friend 's face .	1
finally a single word came back from nazaret .	1
`` what ? ? ? ? ? ''	1
`` there 's no time to explain it to you right now , but i 'm here with your brother , and he was involved with some people ? .anyway , he knows you are in trouble .	1
some really bad people are going to come looking for your family to kill you .	1
you have to run .	1
now ! ''	1
`` tell them to go to the hostel salta , '' alejo whispered , leaning over wara and gripping the edge of the desk .	1
`` alejo says to go to the hostel salta now ! ''	1
wara 's fingers flew across the keys .	1
`` do they remember where it is ? ''	1
`` you know where it is , right ? ''	1
apparently the martir family had experience with the place , maybe knew the owners .	1
a pause .	1
`` yes , i remember . ''	1
wara could almost see tears slipping down nazaret 's cheeks .	1
`` they need to register as the rojas family , '' alejo told her .	1
`` well meet them there . ''	1
as wara typed , she heard the airplane being fired up outside and wished she was already in it , soaring towards cochabamba .	1
`` they have to turn their cell phones off and leave them behind or they will be tracked , '' alejo whispered lowly , and she passed along the instructions .	1
`` tell my brother i love him . ''	1
wara glanced down and saw that nazaret had left one final message , and that she was gone .	1
for once , her status was listed as offline .	1
it looked very final .	1
alejo was staring at what his sister had typed .	1
he slid his hands over to the keyboard and nudged wara 's out of the way .	1
`` i 'm erasing this conversation , '' he said .	1
`` they 're going to come here when they realize i 'm gone . ''	1
one last click of the keyboard , and then alejo scooped up the clothes alexis had left and laid them on wara 's lap .	1
`` put these on in here , '' he instructed .	1
`` i 'm going to help boris ready the plane . ''	1
wordlessly , wara gripped the pile of clothes and forced herself to rise from the computer chair as alejo closed the door behind him .	1
the windows in the small room were covered by rickety bamboo blinds .	1
alexis had been so kind as to donate a pair of gray jogging pants that had sparkly pink lips on the rear and said diva .	1
the shirt was orange with a koala , or wombat , or some such thing cheerily stuffing a stalk of bamboo into its mouth .	1
wara managed to put everything on and slipped into a pair of white rubber flip flops with large silver jewels lining the straps .	1
this is a lot of bling .	1
underneath the jewels , her smudged toes wiggled back at her , adorned with a myriad of henna flowers .	1
wara clamped one hand on the bamboo desk unsteadily as her memory flashed back to the pickup truck and noah sitting at her side , just about to see her henna tattoos when lzaro began to speak .	1
go outside , she ordered herself , gritting her teeth .	1
get on the plane and find the martirs .	1
just find them .	1
17 brick red the white toyota corolla taxi squeezed into a spot along the curb , directly in front of an elderly man with his wooden cart full of sea green chinese fingernail clippers and long tubes of colgate toothpaste .	1
alejo paid the taxi driver in a hurry , then nearly took out the corner of the elderly man 's decrepit cart as he yanked open the back door on wara 's side and tried to help her out .	1
she stared at his outstretched hand as if it were a poisonous millipede and he staggered back , nearly tripping on the cart 's metal wheel .	1
wara frowned at him and eased herself out of the taxi , obviously in pain and very angry .	1
they both headed for the steps of the hostal salta .	1
the place was just as alejo remembered it , back when his dad 's friend from church used to run it .	1
three unlit stars sagged on a brick red wall splattered with graffiti .	1
the hostel was six skinny floors , straight up , smack dab in the center of the market .	1
it was now sundown , and despite the chill , alejo felt feverish .	1
if something happened to his family , he would never forgive himself .	1
inside , wara veered off towards the sofas in the waiting area , just like he 'd instructed her in the taxi .	1
they needed to not call attention to themselves , and walking into a hotel with a swollen , purple nose was a good way to make someone remember you .	1
alejo signed the check-in papers and got the key , making animated conversation about the latest soccer game with the kid at the counter , all the while dying inside .	1
`` got the keys , honey , '' he called to wara , throwing her one of his best grins .	1
`` ready to go upstairs ? ''	1
the guy behind the counter must think he was the cheapest guy in the world , bringing his date to a dive like this .	1
but cheap hostels did n't ask for copies of your id .	1
alejo slung an arm around wara 's shoulder and pulled her into his side as they made for the stairs , hoping it looked romantic instead of like he was trying to hide her .	1
wara panted right behind him up three flights of stairs .	1
he had gotten them the room right next to pablo martir .	1
alias pablo rojas .	1
his family had made it here .	1
and he was going to have to face them .	1
alejo stopped in front of room 303 and rapped on the door , blinking away a bead of sweat that ran through his lashes and into his eye .	1
a hurried grinding noise sounded inside as the door quivered .	1
`` si ? ''	1
wara whispered loudly through the door , shoulders sagging with relief .	1
`` it 's me .	1
we 're here . ''	1
the door opened with a soft whoosh , revealing an entire clan of people , gathered behind alejo 's father in a nervous cluster .	1
alejo blinked .	1
and stared .	1
pablo martir looked the same , except for the sprinkling of silver in his jet black hair .	1
he was a little shorter than alejo , but the square jaw that the pastor clenched as he stared at alejo was the same one alejo saw in the mirror every day .	1
`` hello , '' he stammered .	1
then , `` c'mon , we should get inside '' .	1
head spinning , he guided wara by the arm through the doorway as his parents and all the children scuttled out of his way .	1
alejo closed the door with one foot and slid the deadbolt into place .	1
his mother stood there , older but still beautiful .	1
had he really not seen his mother in so many years ?	1
noly martir was staring at him as if she were seeing a ghost .	1
`` i-i 'm glad that you 're here , '' he said hoarsely .	1
next to him , wara sunk onto one of the room 's many beds .	1
the room was large and lined with about eight single beds , all with pink pinstriped sheets .	1
alejo paced to each of the windows , making sure they were secured and not easy to open .	1
`` anyone following you on your way here ? ''	1
he asked them .	1
`` any strange cars outside your house ? ''	1
everyone shook their heads no , staring at him with wide hazel eyes that mirrored his own .	1
`` everyone left behind their cell phones ? ''	1
alejo was relieved that they all nodded .	1
he had a couple of implanted tracking devices , in case anyone needed to track him when he was on assignment .	1
they would n't be a problem now , though , because the things had to be activated at close range by whoever was going to track him .	1
the teenager who must be his little brother nathaniel watched him with something like awe , never leaving his mother 's side .	1
when alejo left cochabamba to live with his uncle , nathaniel had been two and toddling around the patio in soiled pampers .	1
nareth , nadia , nestor , and naveli huddled on one of the beds , not recognizing him even a bit .	1
they had all been little babies when he stopped by his parents ' house for the only time after running away .	1
he only went home to get some of his clothes and cds .	1
just a quick stop before he headed back to santa cruz and his uncle on the bus .	1
no time to spend with a preachy old preacher and a mother who constantly prodded about how he was doing and a house-full of raucous little martirs who kept multiplying like rabbits .	1
naveli had been born several years after he had last seen his family .	1
now he picked her out right away , a little seven-year old hanging on one of pastor martir 's legs , whimpering .	1
alejo sank down onto one of the unmade beds and planted his feet firmly on the floor , determined not to be sick .	1
`` there are definitely some things you need to know , '' he swallowed hard , `` now that i 've gotten you in this mess , but first ? ''	1
he stood up stiffly from the bed and fought the urge to pace .	1
`` we need to get wara to a doctor , '' pastor martir interrupted with concern , staring at wara and surely thinking about the fact that she had been in a near-fatal bus accident .	1
alejo held up one hand .	1
`` i know that she 's in some pain , but she 'll be fine .	1
i asked the guy downstairs to have a taxi sent over with some anti-inflammatories from the pharmacy .	1
the nose is probably broken , but i wo n't be able to tell for forty-eight hours if it needs to be set .	1
the swelling has to go down first . ''	1
noly and nazaret audibly gasped as they swung around toward wara , noticing for the first time her puffy , bruised face .	1
crusty patches of blood had dried around her violet and yellow nose .	1
alejo felt low as a dog , knowing everyone was looking at wara and assuming this had happened to her in the bus accident .	1
the accident that he had caused .	1
before punching a girl in the face and knocking her to the ground , then dragging her away with a knife to the throat .	1
`` oh dear lord !	1
the accident ! ''	1
noly gasped , catching her hand over her mouth .	1
`` i still ca n't believe ? we heard on the news that everyone was dead , even though sar search and rescue has just begun to bring up the bodies .	1
and then you chatted with nazaret ? ''	1
noly 's pale face flashed back towards alejo .	1
`` and she said you were with alejandro .	1
wara ? ''	1
nazaret 's mother hesitated , then tentatively asked , `` noah was with you .	1
do you know ? ? ''	1
`` i do n't know ? what happened to noah , '' wara said , expression clearly saying she wished alejo would slither away like the snake that he was .	1
`` i was thrown out of the bus .	1
he was sitting right by me , but i could n't find him . ''	1
her lip shook , and she visibly forced herself not to cry .	1
`` these guys , '' she jerked her chin over alejo 's way in the bolivian style of pointing , `` say that no one else but me survived .	1
i passed out , and then was picked up , by the killers . ''	1
nazaret 's blond ringlets appeared next to her mother , eyes full of tears .	1
alejo remembered her , the sister closest to him in age .	1
and suddenly he knew he 'd missed her .	1
`` wara ? ''	1
she said , `` they say on the news it will take at least another day to continue the search for survivors and ? bring up the rest of the bodies . ''	1
her voice choked and she grabbed onto her mother for support .	1
`` the bus fell more than a thousand feet down the ravine , and then it-it exploded .	1
i just ca n't believe you 're alive ! ''	1
nazaret was sobbing now , and alejo felt as if he were in another world , a twilight zone that could not be reality .	1
never in his worst nightmares had he imagined being reunited with his family like this .	1
`` wara , '' noly martir 's tear-stained voice continued , `` a man from noah 's mission told me today that noah 's parents will be in la paz by tomorrow night .	1
your parents were still waiting to see what happens .	1
the sar search and rescue have n't ? found any one who survived the crash .	1
everyone from the bus is presumed dead . ''	1
alejo felt his fists clench hard at his sides , the words hitting him like a load of bricks .	1
franco salazar must be dead .	1
and wara and noah paid the price for the man 's sins .	1
everyone was crying , well at least it seemed like it .	1
his mother , his sister nazaret , several of the little kids whose faces he did n't even recognize .	1
alejo 's chest began to constrict , and he tried in vain to be rational .	1
he had thought this out .	1
salazar needed to die , whatever the cost .	1
of course it was possible there could be other casualties .	1
i am a murderer .	1
`` alejo . ''	1
the broken voice of his father sliced through his heart .	1
alejo turned towards him as if in daze .	1
pablo martir 's eyes were red-rimmed as alejo managed to meet them , steeling himself to do the right thing and give whatever it took of himself to make this right , as much as possible .	1
i , alejandro benjamin martir , am a murderer , and it 's time to pay .	1
`` son , '' pastor martir began , `` wara said that she was found by the killers . ''	1
alejo 's father placed one protective hand on his wife 's shoulder , moving in front of her and nathaniel as he spoke .	1
`` and that she was with you . ''	1
the unspoken question hung in the air , surrounded by children 's shuddering sobs .	1
as if in slow motion , one by one , the other members of the martir family moved up next to their father , warily , staring at him with those hazel eyes .	1
the little one , naveli , sniffed loudly and cried , `` noah ! ''	1
`` i 'll tell you everything , '' alejo promised hoarsely .	1
`` but not in front of the children .	1
18 dark alejo led his parents up to the roof , followed by nazareth and nathaniel .	1
his heart ached as he left wara with the youngest children in the room and pushed open a door that led to the flat concrete roof of the hostal salta .	1
a high brick wall held together with globs of roughly-formed gray mortar provided privacy .	1
a few threadbare , freshly-washed sheets flapped in the breeze in one corner of the roof , drying in the fading sunshine .	1
alejo trudged to the center of the roof , where rusty metal chairs circled a wobbly table .	1
he absently stared at the surrounding buildings , praying-yes , praying-that there would n't be any problems with security at their present location for at least the next few hours , until he could explain to his parents how it came to be that he had set assassins on the trail of his baby sisters .	1
a squeaking of metal told him that his family had taken seats in the awkward silence , unsure of what to do .	1
my parents may have done many things that were wrong , but they and the kids did n't deserve this .	1
the silence suffocated , and alejo needed to escape it .	1
`` i work with a group that partners with hezbollah , '' he finally said , avoiding nazaret 's teary gaze .	1
with a start , he wondered if he should use the past tense .	1
everything is happening so fast ?	1
`` until this afternoon . ''	1
for the first time in a very long while , alejo found himself struggling for words .	1
how could he explain who he was , when his family had not known him for fourteen years ?	1
and who are you now ?	1
alejo thought .	1
do you even know ?	1
nazaret was staring at him , white face stricken with shock .	1
`` you 're a muslim ?	1
hezbollah ?	1
they 're terrorists ! ''	1
`` no , hezbollah has renounced terrorism , '' alejo insisted .	1
`` you 're thinking of hamas .	1
or al-qaeda . ''	1
alejo paused , trying to come up with words .	1
`` i was a muslim .	1
i ? am not anymore . ''	1
he could n't even bring himself to mention the name of jesus in this discussion as his reason for leaving islam .	1
the weight of what he had done felt as if it could never be erased .	1
alejo cleared his face of emotion and tried to state the facts clearly .	1
`` i was the leader of a team in an organization that kills evil men .	1
my team put explosives on the bus that left coroico on sunday night .	1
it was supposed to contain only the targets , but noah and wara apparently got on the bus at the last minute .	1
the men from my team brought wara to me , after they found her by the road , alive .	1
they would have killed her too , and i left with her to avoid that .	1
so i suppose my membership in the organization has been canceled . ''	1
alejo 's mouth flattened into a wry , grim line .	1
`` wara 's bus ! ''	1
pablo martir 's face flooded red .	1
his knuckles tightened violently around the edge of his chair .	1
`` you ? you did that ? ''	1
nazaret squeaked .	1
everyone else seemed too horrified to even speak .	1
`` not only that , '' alejo 's voice was strained , `` but when i left the organization , i put your lives in danger .	1
they do n't like traitors and as soon as they found out i left with wara , i 'm sure they started to look for you .	1
i was a leader , and the punishment for leaving is death for my family . ''	1
now alejo leaned back into his chair , hating the looks on their faces , hating that he was the one who had caused all this .	1
wara said they have prayed for me for years , that i would be safe and following jesus , he remembered bitterly .	1
and now i show up , a muslim , a criminal , who has ruined their lives .	1
`` oh god , '' noly martir whispered , covering her mouth with her hand .	1
for a second no one could speak .	1
then alejo 's mother stood up unevenly from the iron chair , a look of intense sadness quivering on her face .	1
`` alejo , those are your little brothers and sisters below us in that room .	1
are they safe sleeping here , with you ?	1
what is going to happen to them ?	1
oh god , '' she repeated , her voice breaking .	1
`` you never even knew them , and already you have made their lives forfeit . ''	1
`` noah ! ''	1
nazaret cried , breaking into sobs as well , dropping down onto her knees on the concrete floor .	1
`` and wara ? why ?	1
what have you done to them ?	1
alejo , do n't you know how much i loved you ?	1
how much i missed you ? ''	1
`` wara told me , '' alejo muttered , struggling to meet his sister 's weepy eyes .	1
he turned towards his mother and held out a hand towards her , then dropped it to his side .	1
`` i will do all that i can to keep them safe while they 're sleeping , '' he promised gravely .	1
alejo felt that until now his father had been ominously silent .	1
dropping down on a stack of concrete blocks facing his family , alejo watched him out of the corner of his eye , struggling against his will with all the ancient bitterness that welled up in the presence of pablo martir .	1
was the pastor shocked that his son had been living as a muslim ?	1
well , i was happy as a muslim , dad .	1
did you really , honestly expect me to want to be a christian ?	1
did you ever realize what you had done , when you heard about ruben ?	1
apparently , if ruben had affected his family at all , they had recovered just fine .	1
word was that pablo martir was still a pastor .	1
not much appeared to have changed .	1
alejo 's father leaned back in his chair with a firm , metallic clink as the legs shifted against the uneven concrete .	1
alejo jerked his head around to look at him , eyes blank , ready to be verbally decimated .	1
he was almost looking forward to it .	1
`` amor , '' pablo began , in a deep , only slightly unsteady voice directed at his wife .	1
`` please go back downstairs with the kids and stay with wara .	1
i need to talk with our son ? alone . ''	1
fine , alejo steeled himself .	1
man to man .	1
alejo was glad his father appeared sufficiently cool-headed and rational , even after alejo 's horrifying revelation .	1
he needed to talk with his father about a plan to save their lives .	1
it was a heavy first conversation , all in all , after fourteen years .	1
noly and nazaret still could n't speak , and the two of them made their way unsteadily towards the black door that led back to their room .	1
nathaniel followed them slowly , eyes dark , glancing back at his long-lost brother with a mixture of morbid curiosity and fear .	1
he gently closed the rusting door with a slight clang behind him .	1
alejo opened his mouth to speak as pablo abruptly pushed one of the wrought-iron chairs across the concrete with his foot , causing a high-pitched scraping sound .	1
`` please sit down . ''	1
alejo 's father motioned towards the chair , directly across the table from himself , with his chin .	1
alejo sat down in the chair , hiding his uneasiness .	1
`` are your brothers , sisters , and your mother safe downstairs ? ''	1
pablo asked first .	1
his voice was even and low , but alejo noticed a bead of sweat riding his father 's forehead .	1
`` for now .	1
i have to get all of you out of here as soon as possible .	1
it 's ? not safe for you here anymore , and you 'll all have to ? leave the country . ''	1
alejo winced as he heard his own words , suddenly realizing how crazy they sounded .	1
i have n't seen them in years , and now i show up and tell them they have to leave the only country they 've ever known .	1
now .	1
`` you need to explain this to me again , '' pablo sighed seriously .	1
`` you were involved with a muslim organization that you have become uninvolved with , and because of that they are after us , to kill us ? ''	1
alejo nodded , miserable .	1
`` yep , they as in some pretty well-trained , smart guys .	1
if i do n't get you into hiding , they will find you . ''	1
now a little of his father 's composure crumpled and he swallowed hard before getting out the next question .	1
`` you ? killed noah ?	1
the bus ? you ?	1
did that ? ''	1
had he not believed it before ?	1
bile rushed into alejo 's stomach and he curled his fingers around the chair 's sharp armrests with an iron grip to avoid once again emptying his stomach .	1
he had never seen the man , but noah had been one of his sister 's best friends .	1
in the taxi , wara had told him how noah had been in charge of getting his sister home safely every night they worked until late at a caf in downtown cochabamba .	1
`` franco salazar was on the bus , heading back to la paz , '' alejo managed .	1
`` he was an evil man , and the bomb was meant for him . ''	1
alejo 's father 's face looked very pained , and he searched his son 's eyes carefully .	1
alejo felt sick , not at all ready to get into a discussion of the past with his father .	1
his father 's face , however , was unreadable .	1
`` did you only come back to warn us because we are your family ? ''	1
alejo nearly shot out of his chair .	1
`` no !	1
i told you , i 'm not a muslim anymore , and i have left the organization !	1
i knew i needed to leave for a while , when i realized that i believe what jesus taught , not islam .	1
but i found out that if i left , they would come after you ! ''	1
rambling and stammering , alejo 's statement about believing jesus obviously came as another shock to his father .	1
surely the last thing that makes any sense right now is to hear that his son has just left islam , after committing murder , and is now declaring himself to be a follower of jesus .	1
alejo groaned and leaned back heavily in his chair .	1
`` i did n't want anything to happen to you , '' he ground out flatly , `` but they were about to slit wara 's throat .	1
i had to leave with her . ''	1
`` thank god you did ? ''	1
pablo muttered , appearing to be still trying to take it all in .	1
`` so , you kill people as part of your job , but you decided to help wara .	1
and now you left that job ? ''	1
`` dad . ''	1
alejo cut him off , his whole body tense .	1
`` i ca n't talk about all this now .	1
i just ca n't .	1
i feel bad-it 's been a long time , and i just show up and ruin your lives .	1
for that , you do n't know how sorry i am .	1
now , unfortunately , we 've got to talk about getting you all out of here .	1
i have more than enough money , and i 'll do whatever it takes . ''	1
pablo seemed hurt by alejo 's tone , and he stared at his son , maybe trying to find the skinny fourteen year old boy who had left his house in anger .	1
alejo shifted his eyes uncomfortably , refused to let his gaze ride to the floor .	1
`` son , '' pastor martir finally said , voice breaking a little , `` where have you been ?	1
your mother thought you must be dead .	1
or working for drug dealers , in prison ? ''	1
`` well , '' alejo clipped , stomach tight , `` as you can see , everything is so much better than you imagined . ''	1
he immediately regretted his sarcastic words as his father looked away .	1
`` dad , '' alejo said with a sigh , `` there 's nothing i can do to make this reunion a happy one for you . ''	1
his father looked dazed , then asked , `` so this was all about franco salazar ? ''	1
alejo felt his heart leap into his chest , and the acid that rushed into his stomach told him that there was no way he could talk about this with his father , not now .	1
`` i told you , dad , i just ca n't talk about it , '' he insisted , eyes dark .	1
pablo martir 's face looked so pained that alejo tried to soften his tone , ignoring the nausea .	1
`` maybe someday we can talk .	1
but not today .	1
right now the only thing that is important is getting you all out of here , so you can live . ''	1
the strong shoulders of alejo 's father finally slanted as he crumpled back into the chair , desolate .	1
alejo 's footsteps dragged as he trudged down the narrow stairs , leaving his father alone on the hostel roof .	1
seeing his parents again still had the sheen of unreality .	1
a dark , nightmare-ish unreality , in light of the situation he had put his entire family in .	1
his mother was right .	1
he was still confused about half of the kids downstairs , which face went with what name .	1
he did n't know them .	1
but they were his brothers and sisters , for goodness sake !	1
alejo loosed a heavy sigh and waited outside the hostel room door , fighting the urge to find cigarettes and do some serious smoking .	1
he 'd quit years ago , after finding that wheezing while trying to outrun danger and bullets could be pretty inconvenient .	1
and now , suddenly , that life was over .	1
he , alejo martir , was no longer employed by the prism , and he might never see his team , who were like brothers , again .	1
and if he did ever see their faces , it could be behind the muzzle of a gun .	1
alejo blinked , startled , as the wooden door jerked open and he found himself facing nazaret .	1
`` you should n't have opened to me , '' he scolded softly .	1
`` ask first .	1
you did n't know who i was . ''	1
nazaret 's round face waned exhausted .	1
she met his eyes sadly , shattering him with a million memories of blanket forts under the dining room table and licking popsicles on the front porch .	1
`` i still do n't know who you are , '' she said , then left him standing at the door and returned to flop onto an unmade bed .	1
alejo carefully closed the door then turned to his youngest siblings , trying a reassuring smile .	1
`` your dad will be down in a minute , '' he told them .	1
they 're probably worried i left him dead up there on the roof .	1
what kind of brother am i ?	1
alejo forced his gaze from the wide-eyed little martirs to his mother and wara , sitting wearily together on one of the beds he was glad to see pills on the bedside table ; the stuff he had ordered must have arrived from the pharmacy .	1
wara and noly had obviously been in deep discussion just before alejo interrupted them and his heart sunk three notches lower , easily imagining that little chat .	1
there would be the part about how alejo had smacked her in the face , then nearly slit her throat .	1
and before that , how he had handcuffed her and kissed her .	1
alejo felt his face heat .	1
no matter how highly he thought of himself and his problem-solving abilities , there really was no fixing this situation , was there ?	1
alejo suddenly felt very tired and sank down onto a bed across from wara .	1
`` we should call your family , '' he said .	1
wara speared him with reddened eyes .	1
`` i already did .	1
from the street .	1
i called the bennesons , who work with my mission , too . ''	1
alejo nodded once , admiring how she seemed to make good decisions even in stressful situations .	1
`` they must want you to come home , right away . ''	1
noly martir lowered her brows at her son , expression a mixture of love and annoyance .	1
`` of course they do , alejandro .	1
their daughter almost died .	1
but she wo n't go . ''	1
alejo eyed wara , whose jaw was set firmly .	1
`` she wo n't go until she finds out if noah is still alive . ''	1
alejo remained silent , removing his gaze from his mother and sister and folding his arms across his chest .	1
his mother and sister must think him a psychopath .	1
and maybe i am .	1
keys jingled in the lock and alejo tensed , then relaxed as pablo martir entered the room .	1
it was time to leave this room , and quickly .	1
he and wara would be just on the other side of the thin wall , definitely within his ear shot in case of danger .	1
basically ignoring his wayward oldest son , pastor martir walked among his younger children , forcing a smile and patting them each on the head .	1
noly pulled little naveli onto her lap and kissed her .	1
`` i 've been talking with your brother , '' pablo addressed the whole family , `` and he has some very good ideas of how to help us , which we 'll talk about tomorrow .	1
now it 's time for all of us to sleep , but first we 're going to pray .	1
no matter what happens , god is always with us , and he keeps us all in the palm of his hand . ''	1
strangling on the need to escape this little moment of martir family prayer , alejo quickly stood up and moved towards wara .	1
`` excuse me .	1
i 'll get out of your way so you can take care of your family . ''	1
you sound so cold .	1
as if they were n't your family too .	1
but it had been so long , an entire lifetime .	1
naveli peeped at alejo from long-lashed hazel eyes , lips purple around a giant lollipop .	1
alejo stared at her , then tore his gaze away and motioned to wara .	1
`` i 'm sorry , but you 'd better come with me . ''	1
everyone started , and alejo faced his parents .	1
`` i registered us downstairs together .	1
besides , i told her i 'd take care of her .	1
i 'm not letting her out of my sight . ''	1
alejo was surprised when wara rolled out of bed without arguing and prepared to follow him .	1
the zombie-like expression in her eyes , along with her lack of protest , actually worried him .	1
wara looked ready to collapse .	1
equally as worrying was the fact that no one in his family protested his orders , at least not with words .	1
after all , i suppose you do n't argue with a man who 's just confessed to being a killer , even if he is your own son .	1
wara stumbled next to him towards the door .	1
alejo left his family locked in the room , more disgusted with himself than he had been in a long , long time .	1
19 transparent the door slid open before wara and alejo with a mute whine .	1
alejo flipped on the light switch and wara pushed past him into the room , identical to the martirs ' except that it held only two single beds .	1
past the point of absolute exhaustion , wara stumbled over to one of the beds and kicked off her white flip-flops .	1
the wool blanket covered worn , striped sheets , and she ripped back the covers and fell inside .	1
she forced her breathing to even , willing herself to sleep , just sleep .	1
she was lying here in a hostel room with the man who tried to kill her and noah .	1
only sleep would bring the blessed unconsciousness she craved .	1
but sleep would n't come .	1
her frayed mind whirled around a single thought , faster and faster , polishing it to a weighty obsession .	1
finally , she flipped herself over on the lumpy bed to face alejo , still visible in the dim light of the small bedside lamp .	1
he was hunched over on the edge of the other bed , wearing the same gray t-shirt and cargo pants , head in his hands .	1
for some reason , the thought crossed wara 's mind that those were now his only clothes ; nazaret 's brother had literally left his old life with only the clothes on his back .	1
he frowning , wara realized that he could probably never go back and get any of his stuff from wherever he had lived , because now he was in big trouble .	1
because he had saved wara 's life .	1
`` why did you do it ? ''	1
she wondered out loud .	1
alejo twisted to face her , hazel eyes rimmed in red .	1
`` the bus ? ''	1
`` no-i mean yes .	1
but first-why did you leave your group ?	1
you believed so much in what you were doing you were willing to even kill . ''	1
the words tasted bitter , like copper .	1
`` why would you leave ? ''	1
alejo drew in a breath , and it was sharp , hurried .	1
he took his time , swinging his legs over to the other side of the bed so he could face her , eyes flickering back and forth .	1
the guy looked tortured .	1
he raised his eyes to hers , slowly closed then opened them .	1
`` it started because of jesus , '' he said .	1
`` i realized that i ca n't believe what i believe about him and be a muslim .	1
my group is made up of muslims .	1
but then there is ishmael , our boss . ''	1
he hesitated , eyes flickering again as if seeing some painful scene across the back of his eyelids .	1
wara saw the exact moment he decided to go ahead with whatever it was he was going to tell her .	1
`` ishmael and other powerful men do n't want the word to get out about what i saw in pakistan , '' he said .	1
`` on my last trip there , ishmael took me to the tribal area near afghanistan .	1
that 's a place ? ''	1
`` i know where that is . ''	1
`` ok. '' wara enjoyed the moment of showing him she was n't as dumb as he might think .	1
alejo nodded with respect and continued .	1
`` we were way out in the middle of nowhere , visiting a five-house town near the fighting .	1
and huddled inside one of the buildings where fighters crash when they 're not out shooting rockets at each other , i found about one hundred bolivian teenagers , dressed like mujahedeen , waiting to go back to the skirmish . ''	1
wara frowned , confused .	1
`` what ? ? ''	1
`` that 's how i found out , wara , that ishmael 's foundation has been recruiting among the native peoples , especially in bolivia .	1
he explained to me that the recruiters visit small towns in the countryside and talk to the young guys .	1
they recruit them for islam , but in reality they exploit them , only telling them about an islam that they can join to fight together against a common cause : western imperialism .	1
they tell these converts that they are getting an expense-paid trip overseas to study for free .	1
but they end up in the tribal area , or god knows where else . ''	1
`` the missing ! ''	1
wara repeated the term the quechua women had used on that trip to the bible conference with noah .	1
`` in the countryside , a lot of women told me that their sons have disappeared . ''	1
alejo 's mouth pressed together in a firm line .	1
`` i do n't know how many bolivians are over in pakistan right now , or how many have already been killed .	1
their families will never know . ''	1
he shook his head and then sat up straighter .	1
`` anyway , believing what i do about jesus and finding that out meant it was just a matter of time til i left the prism .	1
when you ? when i saw you ? i had to leave right away . ''	1
alejo 's voice faltered , and he cleared his throat .	1
`` but ? ''	1
wara found she could n't say the thought that had just run through her head .	1
all she could come up with was , `` why did you have to kill us ? ''	1
`` do you really want to know ? ''	1
alejo was quieter than wara had expected .	1
`` it 's not going to make you feel any better , you know .	1
i ca n't fix it . ''	1
`` yes , i want to know .	1
how could you do this ? ''	1
she crossed her arms tighter across her chest and shivered .	1
alejo closed his eyes , then looked away .	1
`` the reason we targeted the bus you were on is because it was chartered by a guy named franco salazar .	1
salazar is ? was ?	1
`` alejo winced but kept going `` ? not only a government official for the state of cochabamba .	1
he was also a child molester , and ran the largest child pornography ring in bolivia and paraguay . ''	1
wara fought to keep her jaw from dropping and stared back at alejo .	1
that guy had been on her bus ?	1
`` he was going to leave for thailand , wara , today , from la paz .	1
did you know thailand is a major center for child prostitution ?	1
this is not the first time salazar has been to thailand . ''	1
alejo 's eyes radiated hurt and horror .	1
despite herself , wara felt her heart twist with disgust for franco salazar-if all of this were really true .	1
why should i believe anything he says ?	1
`` the police would never touch him , '' alejo continued , `` because of bribes , high-up friendships .	1
the man was protected from every angle you can imagine .	1
how many more children would have their lives ruined , while i sat , a 'good ' man , doing nothing ? ''	1
alejo raised his hands to make sarcastic quotation marks in the air around the word `` good '' , lips twisting cynically .	1
he paused , then asked distractedly : `` did my parents ever tell you about ruben mamani ?	1
no , of course not . ''	1
alejo caught wara 's blank look and heaved a sigh .	1
`` they probably forgot .	1
anyway .	1
before franco salazar worked for the national government , he was the mayor of quillacollo . ''	1
a medium-sized town on the outskirts of cochabamba .	1
`` and before my family lived in cochabamba , they lived in quillacollo , where my dad pastored a really big , popular church . ''	1
wara vaguely remembered hearing that years ago pablo martir had been senior pastor of a huge church in quillacollo , with its own radio station , seminary , and everything .	1
alejo was still telling his story .	1
`` my best friend ruben was a year younger than me , and he was from a poorer family , quechua .	1
he loved to come over to my house because we had cable and a big yard , and he lived in a little house with one room .	1
we always played cars and war and everything you can imagine .	1
and , '' alejo 's eyes darkened dangerously , `` we also went together to play basketball at the community center , which was set up so nicely for the boys from the neighborhood by the friendly local mayor , franco salazar . ''	1
wara 's gut began to tell her this story was not going to have a pleasant ending .	1
`` when i was thirteen , '' alejo said in a strangled voice , `` ruben told me that salazar had been abusing him for three years .	1
i told my parents , because i thought they would do something .	1
my dad had a lot of influence in the community .	1
they had a school , and three or four hundred people coming to their church .	1
my dad even had his own radio program .	1
i told them , thinking they would tell the police , that they would help my friend and put salazar in jail .	1
i was thirteen ? i did n't know what to do without their help .	1
well , my parents listened to me , and then they looked at each other with this look .	1
my father told me that we had to keep this to ourselves .	1
and , of course , my mother agreed .	1
biblical submission to your husband and all that . ''	1
alejo 's tanned face had paled in the light of the lamp , and wara frowned deeply , scandalized .	1
alejo was saying the martirs told him not to report child abuse ?	1
`` my parents told me that if we put ourselves on salazar 's bad side , '' alejo said , `` we would lose our permission to have the church in the town .	1
and who would be the light of the gospel to the community then ?	1
they said , if they got involved in this situation , they would lose all their influence for christ . ''	1
a long pause and then , in a more composed voice , `` one month later , ruben ended up in a ditch , dead . ''	1
alejo shrugged , as if all he had said were suddenly of no importance .	1
`` i went to live with my uncle , in santa cruz and went to a high school built by the iranian government .	1
life as a pastor 's kid suddenly just did n't seem palatable to me anymore . ''	1
alejo finished the last sentence of his story in a rush , and then jumped up from the bed , uncomfortable .	1
`` whatever has happened in the past , it ca n't bring back the people who died , '' he was saying , knuckles white , when wara thrust herself up on one elbow and hissed , `` not 'people ' .	1
it was n't 'people ' who died .	1
they had names !	1
noah hearst died !	1
may have died ! ''	1
wara ignored how alejo looked away miserably , probably because she did n't want to give up hope that noah could still have survived .	1
`` they all had names , '' wara found herself rambling , while at the same time thinking about ruben mamani , alejo 's little friend , thrown away like trash into the mud .	1
by a horrible man who abused little children while pretending to be a leader who cared about the people , a benefactor .	1
who built a beautiful community center for desperately poor children to come play basketball , only to lure them into his clutches .	1
it was good he was dead .	1
but why could n't only he be dead !	1
wara felt like sobbing .	1
now alejo did look physically sick , and he turned towards the door as if to go , then stumbled trying to turn around to again face wara .	1
`` salazar was a monster , wara , but what i did is still wrong !	1
i am a murderer .	1
but i did what seemed right in the moment .	1
i had to stop it ?	1
it was the best i could do ! ''	1
with actual tears running out of the corners of his eyes , alejo whirled away and was at the door of their hostel room in two steps , out of it in three .	1
alejo martir had left the room crying .	1
wara covered her head with the blanket and cried too , for noah .	1
and maybe for ruben .	1
20 red white and blue sometime while alejo was still up on the roof , wara fell asleep under the faded sheets and heavy blanket .	1
she was startled , when her eyes cracked open , to see that the hostel room was filled with gray light , filtering through the sheer fabric of the cream curtains .	1
a few fiery rays of sun poked out from behind a tall red brick building .	1
it was morning .	1
wara jerked into a sitting position , flipping her gaze over to alejo 's bed , half-expecting it to still be empty .	1
his body was tucked under the covers , however , back towards wara .	1
at the sound of wara 's movement , alejo inhaled sharply and shot up on one elbow , rolling over onto his back at lightning speed .	1
he seemed relieved to see it was only her .	1
alejo groaned and sank back onto the pillow on his back , black hair sticking up wildly in all directions .	1
he scrubbed both fists across his eyes , then swung his legs over the side of the bed , sitting up to look at her .	1
`` hey , '' he said grimly .	1
feeling the awkwardness , wara did n't respond .	1
after the emotional encounter of last night , she did n't know what to say .	1
if his story were true , it made more sense how he could actually believe god would support killing a man like franco salazar .	1
but the truth was , wara still did n't feel as if she could trust alejo martir at all .	1
he could change personalities in an instant , one minute serious and morose , the next charming and convincing , seemingly able to manipulate anyone into doing what he wanted .	1
she was n't about to trust his story about salazar until she had talked with the martirs and confirmed some facts .	1
wara threw off the covers and headed for the bathroom in alexis ' wrinkled sweat pants and wombat shirt .	1
when she came out of the bathroom , he was waiting , pacing by the window , staring down at the alley outside .	1
`` could you come over to the other room ? ''	1
he asked .	1
`` we really need to talk about some stuff . ''	1
`` ok. '' wara shrugged .	1
she felt a little better than yesterday , after a quick shower .	1
soaking off the dried blood had hurt a lot , and she had washed her face without looking in the mirror , afraid of what she would see .	1
alejo had got her some ibuprofen , but she still felt like some foreign object was lodged on her face , twice the size of her own nose .	1
at least the throbbing had died down .	1
fighting the depression , wara trudged after alejo to the hall and the martirs ' door .	1
it was cracked open , and alejo pushed the deadbolt into place after they slipped inside .	1
`` dad . ''	1
alejo 's voice sounded unnatural saying the word .	1
`` can you come here for a second ?	1
i need to run this by you . ''	1
pablo martir looked as if he had n't slept a wink all night and he was staring out the window at the mountains .	1
`` alright , '' he said , and he and his son moved to one of the beds in the corner , each cautiously sitting down at the furthest extremes possible and beginning a hushed , strained conversation .	1
wara plopped down on a bed next to nazaret and noly at the other side of the room .	1
the kids were huddled on the beds , munching half-heartedly on cheesy empanada pastries and sipping chocolate milk from flimsy plastic cups .	1
the thought of food made wara want to gag .	1
`` have you heard any more news ? ''	1
she asked nazaret 's mom .	1
she was terrified they might have heard more news .	1
as long as there was no news , there was still hope .	1
noly yawned and covered her mouth with one hand .	1
`` no , '' she said , and wara closed her eyes in relief .	1
`` i made a call really early-from the street , of course .	1
alejandro says no cell phones .	1
the bennesons from your mission say they still have n't identified the body of any foreigners .	1
so far , the confirmed dead are a government guy from cochabamba and three of his staff : two women and one man . ''	1
she was so glad they had n't found noah .	1
dead .	1
but a pang came along with it , because those people who died had been on the bus with her .	1
shed seen them whispering and laughing as they got on the bus .	1
when noah decided to get on his knees in the aisle and give her the ring , the people in the back had clapped .	1
she searched for the right words , and finally said , `` i made alejo tell me why he did what he did .	1
he was trying to kill the man who used to be mayor of quillacollo .	1
he said that you guys used to know him . ''	1
`` ah . ''	1
noly 's eyes grew sad , and she glanced over at nazaret .	1
`` franco salazar ? ''	1
`` yeah , '' wara nodded , snatching a watermelon bubble gum from the bedside table and popping it in her mouth .	1
her body seemed to float inches above the bed , and she felt a desperate need for the sugar .	1
`` alejo said that franco salazar was involved in all kinds of horrible stuff .	1
and that he killed a friend of his from when they were little-ruben . ''	1
nazaret 's face went pale .	1
`` i just heard last night .	1
i mean , i remember when little ruben died , but i did n't know ? ''	1
`` she did n't know anything about salazar possibly being involved , '' noly murmured .	1
`` that part of our history is a painful memory that marked our lives forever .	1
the kids were so young they did n't know what was really going on .	1
her father told her last night , because salazar came up when he was talking with alejo . ''	1
noly pointed her chin towards nazaret , who looked conflicted .	1
`` did he tell you we did n't report what happened to ruben ? ''	1
wara rolled her eyes and nodded , waiting for noly to say that idea was ridiculous .	1
but instead , noly 's eyes crinkled as she said , `` we 've regretted that decision , made out of pride and reluctance to lose our place in the community , ever since . ''	1
wara was stunned .	1
she blinked and turned her head towards alejo , deep in discussion with his father .	1
`` alejo ran the day ruben was found dead , just after he turned fourteen , '' noly continued , swallowing hard and swiping at mascara running down one cheek .	1
`` it took years for us to understand how wrong we were .	1
we started the children 's center in villa candelaria to try to repent , somehow .	1
it 's all true , wara .	1
i know why he wanted salazar dead . ''	1
wara was still in a daze when alejo 's voice cut into their conversation .	1
`` you guys are involved with the children 's center in villa candelaria ?	1
i 'm ? surprised .	1
and glad .	1
i 've heard of that place -- -it 's famous all over the country .	1
i just did n't know ? that you were involved . ''	1
`` we are , son , '' pastor martir said from behind him , and alejo nodded slowly , seemingly confused by this new development .	1
`` i talked with ? dad , '' alejo said .	1
the word still seemed to taste bitter in his mouth .	1
`` he thinks it would be good for you all to try to go to the united states .	1
to visit aunt wendy .	1
i have plenty of money , and i 'm going to go get as much as i can out of the bank now , before you go . ''	1
alejo 's family all stared at him with expressions of disbelief that clearly said : go ?	1
you mean like right now ?	1
`` wo n't they be watching the bank ?	1
all your buddies ? ''	1
wara demanded , imagining gabriel and scary benjamin staking out the bank with rifles from a crumbling apartment window across the street .	1
alejo shook his head .	1
`` there are ten branches of my bank here in cochabamba , and they do n't have enough manpower to watch all of them at the same time .	1
today i can get enough to take care of you all for quite awhile , and the rest is in a cayman islands account only i have access to .	1
i 'll get all that to you later . ''	1
pastor martir stood frowning at his son , burly arms crossed in front of his chest .	1
alejo grunted and turned to wara .	1
`` none of the family have passports , except dad .	1
i want to see if the u.s. will give them visas and put them in protection , in exchange for the information i have .	1
we also need to let the embassy know you 're alive . ''	1
he took wara back to their room , and alejo dialed the embassy number on a brand-new cell phone he had picked up across the street .	1
wara took another handful of ibuprofen from the bedside table and forced herself to sip water while alejo talked with someone for quite a long time .	1
by his frustrated expression , wara could tell the conversation did n't go well .	1
`` so ? ''	1
she asked as he punched the end button a little too hard and slammed a fist into the bedpost .	1
`` they agree with you , '' alejo scowled at the little gray phone .	1
`` i do n't think they bought most of what i said , but from the little i told them now , they have decided that i am a terrorist .	1
and , '' alejo hurled the phone onto the bed , obviously using less force than he would have liked , `` the u.s. government does not help the family of terrorists . ''	1
`` what ! ? ''	1
wara squawked .	1
`` they wo n't help them because you 're a terrorist ?	1
but that 's why they need help ! ''	1
alejo 's mouth twisted into a grim smile .	1
`` i guess you 're right .	1
robert cole at the embassy told me to tell you that you should contact them so they can pick you up immediately to send you home , by the way .	1
they are going to call your family right away and confirm that you are alive and well . ''	1
both alejo and wara flinched at that expression .	1
`` they have n't found the bodies of any americans , '' he added after a while , then looked away .	1
wara 's heart revved .	1
they had n't found noah 's body .	1
which meant he could still be alive .	1
he had to still be alive .	1
`` so now where will you send the martirs ? ''	1
she asked shakily .	1
`` since the good old u.s. of a has been so helpful ? ''	1
alejo grimaced and massaged his temple , feet planted on the tile floor .	1
`` everyone i know who could be any help in hiding them is connected to the prism .	1
without all those contacts , i ca n't get passports , visas , anything . ''	1
he let out a frustrated breath and then sat up , looking at wara .	1
`` we 'll go to plan b , '' he announced .	1
`` i 'll put them on a bus to lima this afternoon .	1
they wo n't check passports at the border , since they do n't look like tourists .	1
we 'll take a taxi to sacaba , that little town outside the city , and take a bus from there .	1
the guys , hopefully , will only be watching the main terminal here in the city .	1
they can get passports at the embassy there and take a flight to another country .	1
it 's all so sudden , but we have enough money and i can make a new life for my family . ''	1
alejo sighed slowly , watching wara .	1
`` you should call the embassy to come pick you up , '' he said .	1
wara 's mind was reeling .	1
those guys she had seen on the mountain -- -they would forget about her soon though , right ?	1
she could go home , see her parents , find a new place to live and work ?	1
come back to bolivia someday ?	1
at the moment , wara did n't care at all what she did or where she lived .	1
only two thoughts consumed her mind : seeing the martirs safe and out of this nightmare , and finding noah hearst .	1
`` i ca n't go without noah . ''	1
the words slipped out before wara realized it .	1
alejo looked at her sharply , mouth open as if about to protest but she cut him off .	1
`` i wo n't leave bolivia until i know . ''	1
his mouth snapped shut , and he got up quickly and paced to the other bed , lowering himself down cross-legged on top of the unmade covers .	1
he closed his eyes and massaged his temples even harder .	1
`` i 'll stay with you until they know , '' alejo said finally .	1
`` my family can go on ahead , and we can meet them .	1
i 'm not going to leave you alone . ''	1
`` but ? ''	1
wara tried to protest , but could n't come up with anything reasonable to say .	1
no , you go on .	1
i 'll just ward off all of those killers myself .	1
i did such a lovely job of it last time .	1
alejo 's very presence in the room caused a veritable host of unpleasant sensations in wara 's brain .	1
so why did her heart flood with something like relief at his plan ?	1
`` thank you , '' was all she finally said , fighting hard not to cry .	1
21 cinnamon the hostal salta seemed lonely and depressing after the martirs left .	1
when alejo and wara pulled up in front of the hostel in a white taxi , the street lamps were already gleaming upon the darkened sidewalk , though people still hustled by in both directions .	1
wara supposed it must be around seven o'clock-one hour after she had waved good-bye to the family who had been like her own .	1
she had barely been able to make out each face , peering through the tinted windows of a sleek double-decker bus about to depart for lima , peru .	1
alejo had convinced his family to follow his plan , then had them call a friend from church to bring clothes from the market and food for the trip .	1
all of the kids ' clothes and toys stayed behind .	1
the faded photograph of missing alejandro from nazaret 's dresser .	1
anyone who brought things from the martirs house could be followed back here to the hostel .	1
the younger kids climbed onto the bus at sacaba with huge tears in their eyes .	1
silky gray rain clouds swirled across the evening sky , threatening a downpour as the entire martir family boarded the bus that would take them away from bolivia .	1
nazaret sobbed as she hugged wara , hesitated , and then threw herself at her brother , weeping against his chest .	1
alejo 's back had been towards her , but wara had seen him put his arms around nazaret until she pulled away .	1
now , wara stepped out of the taxi and slammed the door , facing the unlit stars of the hostel .	1
she and alejo , who had tried to kill her , were alone here together , and wara had never felt so strange .	1
the faded pinstriped sheets and lumpy pillows were still waiting .	1
wara felt even more depressed as she entered their hostel room , realizing that alejo was now her only company .	1
maybe she could call nazaret on her long bus trip later , just to hear the sound of a known voice .	1
alejo had picked up several more cheap little prepaid cell phones from the viva shop , and given three to the martirs , plus one to wara .	1
wara had made one call to the bennesons , to ask them to call her on this number as soon as there was any news about noah .	1
explaining why they should n't give the number to anyone else had been tricky , as was trying to tell them why she was n't at home in the apartment below theirs , and could n't come back for safety reasons .	1
why am i here with alejo , instead of letting the u.s. embassy pick me up and take care of me until i know about noah ?	1
after hanging up with the bennesons , the question had bothered her .	1
because the embassy does n't even seem to believe what is going on , wara realized .	1
you do n't know them .	1
alejo is a martir-and you know him .	1
that 's crazy !	1
wara had scolded herself .	1
he 's one of them !	1
alejo closed the door and turned on the light .	1
thirty seconds of silence filled the room , as both of them sunk down onto one of the beds , listless .	1
then he sighed and asked : `` do you want to go to la paz ?	1
the search and rescue efforts are working from there , and it 's the closest major hospital . ''	1
wara stared at him , feeling very weary , having a hard time understanding what he was saying .	1
did she want to go to la paz ?	1
of course !	1
if they find noah that would be where they would take him , the best major hospital .	1
noly said that noah 's parents were going to be in la paz , waiting .	1
but wara could n't decide what she wanted to do at all , except that she wanted to see her best friend who she loved again .	1
`` i do n't know , '' she finally said hoarsely .	1
`` what do you think ? ''	1
alejo looked away .	1
`` they 've been searching for two days now , and they should be done soon .	1
noah lived here ; the funeral will-would be-in cochabamba .	1
i think you should stay here . ''	1
his words hit wara like a punch in the gut .	1
everything alejo said sounded so logical , but the cold reality of making such a decision based on the fact that the funeral would be here ? for a moment she could n't breathe .	1
it took her a long time to collect her thoughts and say , weakly , `` ok. '' all day she had waited with bated breath , feeling that any phone call could bring news that noah had been found , alive .	1
but hearing alejo say that he expected the news would be about the funeral brought wara back down to reality with a very painful crash .	1
after a long while she heard alejo say , `` i told danny downstairs that we 're checking out tonight .	1
we need to move to another place-it wo n't be that hard for the guys to show our picture to reception at all of the cheap hostels in cochabamba , and the longer we stay in one place , the more time they have to do that . ''	1
his voice sounded tight , but calm , not as bone-weary as wara herself felt .	1
`` alright , '' she managed .	1
her eyes were closed , and she felt her breathing slow , suddenly so relaxed she felt almost one with the sagging mattress underneath her .	1
she cleared her throat and mumbled , `` right now ? ''	1
the thought crossed wara 's mind that if she never got up off this bed again , that would be perfectly fine .	1
`` yeah , right now , '' alejo said , almost sounding apologetic .	1
`` we need to get going .	1
and besides , now 's a good time .	1
we 'll be going under cover of darkness . ''	1
wara cracked open her eyes and raised one eyebrow at him .	1
his hazel eyes were watching her , expression unreadable .	1
`` fine , '' she answered him , sliding her eyes back shut .	1
`` but i think you 'll have to pack my bag for me . ''	1
a joke , since her belongings consisted of two changes of clothes the martirs ' friend had brought her from the market , along with a toothbrush and shampoo .	1
alexis ' shiny-reared sweat pants and wombat shirt had found their final resting place in the bathroom trash can .	1
wara realized that alejo had actually gotten up and was bringing her toothbrush from the bathroom .	1
he made sure it was inside the brown plaid bag that had also come from the market , and then slung that and a black backpack that had been brought for him over his shoulder .	1
`` ready ? ''	1
he asked , standing near the door .	1
`` i promise you can sleep when we get to our new place . ''	1
wara sighed loudly and rolled off the bed , hanging on to the side until she was steady .	1
her bleary gaze fell on alejo , and she thought he did n't look quite as threatening now that he was no longer wearing the military-style cargo pants and sweaty gray t-shirt from up on the mountain .	1
he actually looked rather normal now in dark jeans , a hunter green hoodie , and leather tennis shoes .	1
`` are they going to find them ? ''	1
she asked groggily , as she followed alejo out the door into the hallway .	1
without turning around , he answered carefully , `` i do n't think so .	1
i would never forgive myself . ''	1
their taxi sped along the highway towards sacaba , the same route they had taken to say good-bye to the martirs .	1
not even halfway to sacaba , alejo directed the taxi driver to veer off the highway towards a gravel-covered incline .	1
with a sharp tap of the brakes , the driver darted in front of oncoming traffic on the highway 's opposite lane and bumped onto the more uneven road .	1
he then punched the gas , letting the shiny , newer taxi climb up towards wherever their final destination would be .	1
spanish pop music filled the clean , gray interior of the taxi , and the young driver , wearing a peach polo shirt , tapped a muscular forearm against the steering wheel to keep rhythm .	1
this under-maintained road took them higher and higher up one of the mountains at cochabamba 's northern edge , the bumps and ruts jolting the taxi with more violence the farther along they went .	1
three iridescent cds hung from the top of the windshield on gold cords , dangling and swaying with each jolt of the car .	1
`` a los moteles , no amigo ? ''	1
the taxi driver 's eyes met alejo 's in the rear view mirror .	1
`` yep , '' alejo nodded to him , mouth turning up .	1
`` el cupido . ''	1
wara glanced over at alejo sharply .	1
they were entering an area where the dusty road was pock-marked with rocks and shaded by eucalyptus trees .	1
on either side , brightly-painted walls rose up , sporting neon signs with names that did not appear to be those of respectable hotels : safari , the oasis , the `` park drive-in '' , and lover 's paradise .	1
wara stared in disbelief , and then her eyes fell upon a towering sign of a glowing cupid , complete with heart-tipped arrows .	1
and underneath , a giant closed gate painted the color of red hot candies with an enormous pink heart .	1
oh , this was not good .	1
someone had once made a comment to her that in some part of cochabamba there were `` motels '' where one could pay for rooms by the hour , usually for romantic encounters .	1
the taxi that held alejo and wara had pulled up in front of the looming hot pink heart , which now filled the entire windshield .	1
their taxi driver honked twice merrily and waited , still tapping the steering wheel to the rhythm .	1
you have got to be kidding me , wara gaped , then snapped her mouth shut and whirled towards alejo .	1
`` what is this ? ''	1
she hissed .	1
he tried to appear unfazed , obviously having known wara would react this way .	1
`` this is the only place where you can stay without having to show id , '' he whispered in her ear .	1
alejo scooted closer and slung an arm around her shoulder .	1
`` just act natural , ok ?	1
i had to lie through my teeth to get danny back at the salta to let you stay without id , and he only did it because he 's a nice guy .	1
we 've got these nice , dark tinted windows .	1
that 's why i picked this taxi . ''	1
alejo motioned fluidly towards one of the windows , as if waiting for wara to take in how they were invisible to prying eyes outside the taxi and stop being angry that he had brought her to a motel called el cupido .	1
then he continued , squeezing her close against his side for the taxi driver 's benefit .	1
`` probably just some kid will come out to take our money , and then we 've got a room .	1
if the guys from my team would come here , no one has got our id .	1
plus , this place is pretty secretive .	1
i 'm sure you can imagine why '' wara swallowed hard .	1
she closed her eyes and counted to ten , mortally embarrassed , doing her best not to rip herself away from alejo 's grip .	1
just when she thought she could n't stand it a moment longer , the huge wooden door of love swung open by some invisible hand and the idling taxi drove inside .	1
the courtyard they entered was grassy , shaded with trees , and mostly dark .	1
off to the right , wara could see a long row of motel rooms , each sporting a pair of hearts painted on the red hot , numbered doors .	1
stifling a groan , wara leaned her head back onto the seat back .	1
alejo winked at the driver , who seemed to be enjoying this .	1
`` you 'll talk to the boy for us , right ?	1
just slit the window so no one 'll see us . ''	1
`` no problem , '' the guy in the peach shirt nodded , and with one touch of a button the cobalt glass glided a few inches lower , revealing a brief glimpse of a young boy with chocolate skin and a tattered green hulk t-shirt .	1
`` si , amigo ? ''	1
he said into the taxi , and wara was shocked by the squeakiness of the kid 's voice .	1
he could n't be more than ten years old .	1
what was he doing in this kind of place ?	1
`` ask him how much for two days , '' alejo told the driver .	1
`` five hundred bolivianos , '' the taxi driver announced after consulting with the boy outside .	1
he raised his eyebrows at alejo in the mirror .	1
alejo pulled out a fat wad of red one hundred boliviano notes from the pocket of his jeans and peeled five off .	1
the driver passed them through the cracked-open window and the kid counted the money , crisping the bills in his hand with the efficiency of a los vegas casino employee .	1
`` number six , '' the kids squeaked , and passed something metallic and jingly into the interior of the car .	1
alejo snatched the item from the driver 's burly fist , and wara saw it was a single silver key , attached to a key chain with a cherry red , puffy , lace-trimmed heart .	1
alejo started to hand her the key , saw her face , and then lowered his eyes , stuffing the key into the pocket of his hoodie .	1
the driver sealed the window shut with a soft hiss , and then slowly pulled across the grass to leave them closer to the heart doors .	1
without a word , alejo opened the car door for wara , then paid the driver .	1
`` do n't look behind you when you get out , '' alejo breathed into her ear , and wara 's cheeks flamed as she exited into the cool night .	1
she gathered her composure and followed alejo , forcing herself to stare at the double hearts ahead instead of behind her , where she thought the boy who had taken their money might still be watching in the darkness .	1
but then again , the kid was probably already back inside watching cartoons , so used to this life that there was absolutely nothing exciting about the arrival of yet one more couple .	1
`` see , that was n't too bad , '' alejo said under his breath as he jammed the silver key into the lock .	1
the plush heart bobbed around wildly as he turned the key to motel room number six .	1
the wooden door swung open , immersing wara in a warm glow of cinnamon red .	1
the entire interior of the room was varying shades of red .	1
lit , neon red christmas lights ran around the ceiling , and the walls were cherry red and white stripes , crisscrossed with painted cupids , arrows ready to fly .	1
shaggy , worn crimson carpet blanketed the floor , cushioning wara 's ankles as she warily stepped inside .	1
and in the center of the room sat a double bed , fire-truck red satin comforter shimmering under a gaudy gold headboard in the shape of a heart .	1
alejo gingerly closed the door behind them and flipped on the light , causing wara to gasp .	1
a monstrous , cheap crystal chandelier exploded with light above them , and every diamond-shaped light bulb was red , spreading a rosy scarlet hue across everything in the room , including alejo 's face .	1
`` what do you think ? ''	1
he had the audacity to ask with a crooked grin .	1
wara did n't know whether to laugh or run out the door .	1
`` of course you can have the bed .	1
i 'll take that couch . ''	1
wara followed his gaze to the wall , where a plush couch , the color of cinnamon red hot candies , snuggled against the wall .	1
next to it , a wicker chair with a matching footrest was adorned with cushions to match the couch .	1
it was all just too much .	1
`` i hate it ! ''	1
wara responded to his question , turning in a slow circle around the room .	1
`` i have never seen anything so ugly in my entire life .	1
it 's ? indescribable . ''	1
`` i 'm sorry i had to bring you here , '' alejo said , seemingly feeling bad for her .	1
`` it 's just that it really is the best spot to hide ? ''	1
`` yeah , your reasoning does make a twisted kind of sense , '' wara sighed .	1
noah would have chuckled at this , and for sure he could have written a hilarious song about this room with this taylor guitar .	1
nazaret would have been shocked , then dissolved into a fit of giggles .	1
wara missed both of them so much , and felt awfully , terribly alone .	1
alejo hauled the wicker chair over under the room 's only window , a long , rectangular-shaped opening that ran higher than the level of their heads next to the door .	1
he pulled aside the gauzy red curtain and peered outside , probably checking for any bad guys .	1
the gaze he fixed on her as he stepped down from the fuzzy red couch was so like nazaret 's that for a moment she blinked , forgetting he was really so different from the other martirs .	1
`` were you really good friends with all those guys i saw up there ? ''	1
she asked .	1
alejo dragged the wicker chair back to the corner and sat down , considering how much he was going to tell her .	1
finally he said , `` most of the guys that were there at first-the guys that carried you up from the road -- were only there for the weekend , for training .	1
i was n't only in charge of my team , but of training all the guys in most of south america .	1
that 's why they 're going to be so mad . ''	1
that last sentence was muttered .	1
`` four of the guys were on my team-we were like brothers .	1
gabriel , stalin , benjamin , and lzaro .	1
well , not lzaro .	1
he 's new .	1
but gabriel and benjamin and i shared a house together in coroico .	1
and stalin and i have been friends for ten years . ''	1
the memory hit her , leaving a sour taste in her mouth : alejo worked with lzaro .	1
back when she knew him , lzaro had said he was a christian .	1
wara did not even want to think how he had reached the point of becoming a radical muslim who was about to cut her throat .	1
and she really did n't want to talk with alejo about it .	1
she wandered over to the bed and collapsed on it with slumped shoulders .	1
she felt sick and weary to the bone .	1
wara twisted noah 's silver ring on her finger , her only comfort in this awful place .	1
22 sickly pink wara was exhaused .	1
she was suffering , and alejo had done this to her .	1
he watched her , sitting there on the horrible bed in this place he 'd brought her to , playing with a silver ring on her finger .	1
her eyes were ringed in dark circles , glazed over and in another world she shivered and absently scrubbed at her bare arms , trying to get warm .	1
alejo 's heart hurt .	1
he got up and walked over to her backpack by the door and found a black sweater his mom 's friend had brought for wara .	1
`` its cold in here , '' he offered it to her .	1
it was dark outside now , chilly and menacing in the shadow of the darkened andes .	1
she looked into his eyes as he handed her the sweater and her face was bathed in red from gaudy chandelier .	1
her nose was a sickly violet and yellow , puffy under her reddened eyes .	1
it had to hurt .	1
a lot .	1
alejo closed his eyes slowly , then opened them .	1
`` i think we should try to rest . ''	1
he dragged his feet over to the couch .	1
the ugly thing was three cushions wide , good enough for a decent night 's sleep .	1
he curled up facing the wall and stuffed a small , hard red pillow under his head .	1
`` whenever you 're ready , you can turn out the lights , '' he told wara .	1
`` i can sleep anywhere , with lights or without , so do n't worry about me . ''	1
as if she would .	1
alejo grimaced at the back of the couch .	1
he had no idea what else to say .	1
wara switched off the light and covers rustled behind him , then everything fell silent .	1
way too silent .	1
suddenly , the horror of the day pressed into him with a vengeance and it hurt .	1
franco salazar was dead , and he could n't say he was sorry .	1
he believed what he 'd told wara , that he could n't just sit by and watch while thieves attacked the man in the story of the good samaritan ? or while franco salazar abused kids .	1
but he 'd never really thought about other people who could be hurt in the middle of delivering justice to the bad guys .	1
he 'd never laid eyes on noah , but alejo had seen his sister 's tears , heard how the guy played with his little brothers and sisters and made sure nazaret got home safe late at night .	1
for all alejo knew , that silver ring wara was always playing with was a gift from noah .	1
it was obvious she cared about him , a lot .	1
always before , when alejo killed , he had been sure the man who died was scum and deserved whatever he had coming to him .	1
now , for the first time , someone innocent had been taken out along with the bad .	1
alejo knew the reason wara 's presence was undoing him : she was the incarnation of a person simply caught in the crossfire .	1
he felt guilty for the other innocent people on the bus , but he had never seen them .	1
when he looked into wara 's eyes and realized what he had done , there had been no going back .	1
the combination of leaving islam , leaving the prism , and trying to figure out why , if he had done god 's will , he could still feel so wrong , spun alejo 's world upside down .	1
a half-hour or so went by , and wara 's even breathing seemed to indicate that she was asleep .	1
a slightly hellish glow filtered into the dark room through the sheer red curtains from a street lamp in the courtyard outside .	1
alejo closed his eyes but he just could n't sleep .	1
and then there 's my family .	1
who he had avoided in anger for years , then dragged into the very path of death .	1
he kept thinking about his father , and the few words they had had just before the martirs went to sacaba to take the bus away from bolivia .	1
pablo martir told alejo he wanted to speak with him up on the roof again , alone , and alejo had steeled himself for the conversation .	1
he really hoped his father would understand that there was n't much that could be added to what had already been said .	1
there was nothing alejo could say that would make it right .	1
there was nothing his father could say that would make alejo feel more acutely how badly he had messed up , getting his entire family into this situation .	1
there was no other solution that alejo could see to the problem ; even if he would walk right back into coroico and show up at the doorstep of his old house so the prism could shoot him , the 964 would still be angry , and they could still go after his family .	1
and wara was still a witness .	1
alejo had trudged up the concrete steps to the roof , following the broader form of his father .	1
all these years , he had imagined that his father was still occupied as a pastor , preaching that jesus saves while letting the world go to hell .	1
somehow , finding out that he had been directing the only center for children with aids in the country , which would now be left without leadership because of alejo , made alejo feel even more depressed .	1
the faded sheets were still drifting lazily on the line in the afternoon breeze on the hostel rooftop .	1
alejo 's father turned to face his son squarely .	1
`` son , i ca n't tell you how sorry i am we ca n't have more time together .	1
there is so much more i 'd like to talk about , but as you said , now is not the time ? ''	1
his voice cracked a little , and alejo felt his shoulders tense .	1
`` so much time lost , '' pablo continued , `` and now i do n't even know what will happen , what you ? ''	1
he stopped and sighed , obviously thinking something along the lines of , `` ? if you are going to continue being a criminal , because that really complicates our relationship . ''	1
`` the one thing i want to ask you before we leave , though , '' alejo 's father said after the scowl had faded , `` is about what you said before , about jesus .	1
you said that you have been a muslim ? ''	1
`` yep , i 've been a muslim since i was eighteen , '' alejo confirmed dryly , wondering where his father was going with this .	1
`` but you told me that you are no longer a muslim , that you are a christian . ''	1
alejo hesitated , the term christian still racking him with unpleasant sensations of long sermons with too many amens .	1
people pretending to praise god while peeking to see whose hands were raised the highest .	1
little boys dead in the grass so that no one would disrupt the worship of god in the church building every sunday .	1
alejo exhaled loudly .	1
`` i guess so ... dad .	1
i do n't want to be a christian like i was taught .	1
i 'm sorry .	1
when i read the bible and saw what jesus said ? it was like i had never heard most of it before .	1
and i wanted that .	1
i want that .	1
it 's him i want , not a religion . ''	1
pablo sighed deeply , eyes boring into his son 's .	1
then he actually stepped forward to clasp alejo 's shoulder , tears in his eyes .	1
`` we all need a lot of grace right now , '' he said hoarsely .	1
pablo martir let go of his son and turned as if to go , then paused .	1
without looking back he said , `` noah had jesus living in him .	1
he would have forgiven you , alejandro . ''	1
alejo had shivered , staring at the back of his father 's head as he walked towards the metal door that led back downstairs and disappeared .	1
then noah was a better man that i am , he thought .	1
alejo , who usually could sleep like a baby even with a rock for a pillow , finally drifted into a fitful sleep on the soft red couch .	1
he jerked upright at a foreign sound filling the room .	1
a cell phone !	1
slapping around in the darkness , he got a hold on the metal chain of a pink floral lamp next to the couch and yanked it , flooding the motel room with sickly-sweet light .	1
wara had already flown across the room towards her bag and was throwing out clothes , looking for the phone that kept drilling its tinny tune into the night .	1
realizing it was n't there , she dove back for the bed , crawled over it , and grabbed the phone vibrating across the nightstand .	1
her hands were shaking so hard she could hardly flip the thing open to gasp a breathless , `` hello ? ''	1
alejo sank back into the couch , hoping the call was his sister in need of a midnight conversation .	1
the odds were against that , however ; there really was n't a good chance a call in the middle of the night would bring good news .	1
`` yeah , it 's me . ''	1
wara 's voice quivered .	1
she waited , then waited some more .	1
alejo exhaled as her entire body crumpled and sank back into the sheets , seemingly buried in the mass of fluffy pillows and thick satin bedspread .	1
`` when ? ''	1
silence , and then she choked out , `` th-thank you . ''	1
the cell phone shut with a near-silent click , and then alejo saw wara pull the covers up over her head .	1
`` you can go back to sleep , '' she finally said in a voice that did not sound like herself .	1
`` the bennesons just wanted to let me know that the funeral will be tomorrow at ten . ''	1
they found him .	1
alejo 's blood chilled , and he pulled the lamp off quickly , as if afraid to sit any longer in the light when he just found out he had caused a funeral .	1
rubbing his temples , alejo rolled back onto the couch , slowly , staring up at the ceiling .	1
his brain told him he should say something .	1
what kind of man just sat there without saying anything when a woman finds out the guy she loved has died ?	1
alejo did n't even need to run through the possible options in his mind , however , to know that finding something adequate to say to her would be impossible .	1
taking a deep breath , he shivered , eyes fixed on nothing in the darkness until it was nearly morning .	1
a morning in which alejo would go to a funeral .	1
23 bittersweet the morning passed by as if in a dream .	1
after somehow getting ready , wara followed alejo out of el cupido and waited a few blocks away on a shaded corner for a missionary family , the paulsons , to come pick them up .	1
alejo had said something about the prism finding them , so they would need to try to sneak into the house where the funeral would be held .	1
he insisted she call someone with a van so they could hide out lying on the floor .	1
the paulsons had quickly agreed to pick them up .	1
corban and misty paulson had been good friends with noah ; no one said a word during the entire ride to the house where the funeral would be held .	1
a solemn metallic clanging and the stilling of the purring engine told wara that the van had finally arrived inside the gate of the bennesons ' house .	1
she picked herself up off the floor , brushing crumbs off her pants in a daze .	1
she followed alejo and the paulsons across the wide lawn with its spiky green grass , around a multitude of assorted land cruisers and brasilias already parked inside the house 's walls .	1
the zip of cool air inside the shade of the white-walled house hit her face , along with the unnatural hush emanating from within .	1
everyone turned to stare as she slipped through the door .	1
wara swayed on her feet , overcome by the sight of all of her friends , noah 's friends , gathered here , because noah was actually dead .	1
`` wara ! ''	1
tobin was folding her into an embrace against his bony shoulders .	1
`` i ca n't believe this happened to noah .	1
we were so worried .	1
about both of you . ''	1
wara pulled away from him numbly , only to find herself hugged by person after person from her mission .	1
from noah 's church .	1
tobias , the other australian , was scrubbing reddish eyes , obviously trying not to cry as he gave her a quick hug .	1
she saw tobin 's gaze ride up to where alejo stood somewhere in the background , probably looking dangerous and out of place at a funeral with his uncut curly hair and jeans .	1
wara wondered for a brief moment if she should feel like a traitor for daring to come to noah 's funeral with the man who was responsible for his death .	1
but then she realized she could n't feel anything , not yet .	1
`` wara , '' tobias was saying , `` we brought a guitar for you .	1
they want you to sing something for noah-just one song .	1
can you do it ? ''	1
wara gulped , then nodded without thinking .	1
of course she would sing , if it was for noah .	1
it was her last chance .	1
`` thanks , '' tobias nodded and sniffed loudly , laying a hand on her arm .	1
then he was off in the direction of the living room .	1
she did n't know what to do , so she just followed him , practically floating in the sea of people milling around here at noah 's funeral .	1
it was unreal .	1
wara really , really wanted to cry .	1
as she moved to go into the main living area , a huge , arched room painted in bold colors , rough fingers brushed her arm .	1
wara looked up to find eduardo sejas , the good-looking bolivian guy who had been in coroico with noah .	1
his usually twinkling eyes were red-rimmed behind black trendy glasses , and he wore a dark suit and tie .	1
`` wara , '' he started , and then his voice choked .	1
`` you 're still alive .	1
we were so worried ? ''	1
`` is he here ? ''	1
wara heard herself say , glancing towards the living room .	1
`` yeah , '' eduardo said , and sighed .	1
`` i mean , he 's not really here , he 's with god , but ... the casket is in there . ''	1
wara bit her lip and reached up with one hand to push a stray piece of hair out of one eye .	1
as she did , eduardo 's gaze followed her hand , and his mouth opened into a round `` o '' .	1
`` they gave you noah 's ring ? ''	1
he asked , staring at the shining silver on her hand .	1
wara frowned , not sure who he was talking about .	1
eduardo grabbed her hand quickly and examined the ring .	1
`` is n't that noah 's ring ? ''	1
he lifted his eyes to hers again , blinking behind the trendy glasses .	1
`` did you find it after the accident ? ''	1
`` no , '' wara said , realizing dully that eduardo , as one of noah 's best friends , must have seen this ring sometime before .	1
she had never seen noah wearing it .	1
eduardo sniffed loudly , but his face lit up .	1
`` he gave it to you ? ''	1
`` yeah , '' wara said hesitantly , not sure where this was leading .	1
why did it really matter ?	1
`` that 's awesome ! ''	1
eduardo was actually grinning .	1
`` what ? ''	1
in her present condition , wara was obviously missing something .	1
`` noah saved that ring for a really long time , '' eduardo explained slowly , as if revealing a delicious secret .	1
`` he said that he did n't want to just casually date someone , but that when he started a relationship he wanted it to be serious .	1
well , a lot of the guys , we used to always tell him , 'well , start a relationship then !	1
what are you waiting for ? '	1
but noah would always say that he thought maybe god wanted him to be single , since god had n't brought the right girl along yet .	1
i told him so many times that that was a bunch of hogwash .	1
he knew several great girls .	1
noah was just plain scared of commitment !	1
he told me that his parents always fought like cats and dogs , and that they never loved each other a day in their lives . ''	1
wara swallowed hard and circled the ring around her finger .	1
she knew that noah 's relationship with his parents was n't the best , mostly due to his decision to be a missionary instead of pursuing a career that would make lots of money .	1
he had never mentioned anything about his parents ' relationship with each other .	1
`` so , last weekend , when he was going to coroico , '' eduardo was going on , `` noah told me that he was taking the ring along , since god supposedly was n't bringing any girls into his life that he could give it to and he had reached the ripe old age of twenty-eight .	1
he was just going to ceremoniously throw it out the side of the bus , over the road of death .	1
to put to death the idea of marriage and living happily ever after . ''	1
eduardo 's eyes were swimming but the twinkle was back `` but it looks like he did n't throw the ring over after all .	1
he gave it to you ... right ? ''	1
wara just stared at him , because her throat hurt too much to try to speak .	1
she gave a curt nod , not even trying to pretend she was n't about to cry .	1
eduardo looked very satisfied .	1
`` thank you , '' she finally whispered , wanting to ask more before she had to go into the living room .	1
but then she saw the couple dressed in black , standing at the back of the room through the wide double doors , weeping .	1
wara had never seen their picture , but the look of utter desolation on their faces and the way their gaze shifted uncomfortably around the room as if they were in a strange land they had never before imagined they would see , told her that these were noah 's parents .	1
`` his mom and dad . ''	1
eduardo touched wara 's arm , following the direction of her gaze .	1
`` we 'll talk another time , ok ? ''	1
wara nodded , and glanced at alejo , who was standing , tight-lipped behind her , pale face revealing that he had heard who was in the next room .	1
she turned her back to him and forced herself to walk through the open double doors , completely ignoring the small , hushed groups of people clustered around the room , whispering .	1
her mind registered that the music she heard was noah , one of the cds he had recorded with the guys for fun at the studio on espaa .	1
his voice cut her to the heart .	1
why could n't that really be you ?	1
a long table was set up in the corner with punch and refreshments .	1
ridiculous .	1
who could eat now ?	1
along the burgundy wall at the opposite side of the living room was an espresso-colored casket , lying on a curled metal stand , closed .	1
wara 's knees felt weak .	1
before she could think she threw herself across the tile floor and drew up to the edge of the long , dark casket , spreading her hands out along the smooth wood .	1
a tear dripped off her chin onto noah 's casket , and wara pressed her forehead into the cool wood , eyes closed .	1
if the world ended now , that would be just fine .	1
the shaky voice came from a woman just behind wara .	1
`` were you one of his friends ? ''	1
she reluctantly raised her head and stared at the speaker through bleary eyes .	1
it was noah 's mother : slim and fashionable , wearing a short black suit dress and a string of platinum-colored pearls , bobbed hair dyed blond gave her the appearance of being much younger than she must be .	1
wara 's gaze shifted behind her and saw the portly , balding man that must be noah 's father .	1
he seemed at home in an expensive black suit with a sky blue tie .	1
drops of perspiration trickled down his forehead despite the coolness of the room .	1
`` yes , '' wara heard herself answer .	1
the overweight father shuffled uncomfortably forward , glancing around the room as if he would give his entire fortune to be anywhere but here .	1
he took his place at his wife 's side and tried to focus his attention on wara .	1
wara ignored the trail left by the tear down her right cheek .	1
`` are you noah 's parents ? ''	1
`` yes , we are ? were ? his parents . ''	1
noah 's mother had mascara smears under her emerald green eyes , and wara 's heart flipped , recognizing noah 's eyes in hers .	1
with a stifled sob , his mother covered her mouth with one manicured hand and wiped away a stray tear with the other .	1
`` and you must have been a good friend , '' she sniffed .	1
wara blurted out , `` i was ? me and noah were ? i loved him .	1
i was his girlfriend . ''	1
yes , for a few minutes , but what did that matter now ?	1
she had noah 's ring , and she knew that he had wanted to be with her .	1
noah 's father looked shocked , and his mother burst into tears .	1
wara could n't miss mr. hearst 's disparaging look that traveled over wara 's rumpled clothing , henna tattoos , nose ring , and bruised face .	1
surely she did n't look fit to be at a funeral , much less to be the girlfriend of their precious son from a wealthy family .	1
but noah 's mother just waved her hand at her husband and held two slender white arms out toward wara for an embrace .	1
mrs. hearst delicately pulled her forward for a hug , and while wara was pressed against her shoulder she noticed a framed photograph on top of the casket .	1
a clean-cut young man wearing a blue dress shirt and a silk tie smiled confidently from the picture , looking for all the world like a slick lawyer or a successful salesman .	1
with a gasp , wara realized she was looking at a younger noah , long hair clipped off , clean-shaven and wearing a tie .	1
what would noah 's parents think if they had seen him how she had known him , with the tattoo and terribly not cool clothes , playing soccer in the dust with school children ?	1
this is how they wanted him to be , she thought miserably .	1
this picture must be from when he was studying international business .	1
next to the larger photograph were two smaller ones , also in gold-gilded frames .	1
one was a blond boy , about six years old , wearing a star wars t-shirt and grinning at the camera while missing both front teeth .	1
wara had never seen a photo of noah as a kid .	1
the other frame showed a chubby baby with bright emerald eyes , stuffed into a starched white suit and staring at the camera while a trail of drool escaped from one side of his rosebud lips .	1
mrs. hearst let her go , again swiping at tears under her painted eyes .	1
`` i did n't know he had a girlfriend `` she rasped .	1
`` he never told us .	1
oh , we wasted so much time ? ''	1
noah 's mom broke off , bit her lip , then tried to compose herself .	1
`` of course i do n't know your parents , but i would like to tell you , on behalf of noah 's parents , whose hearts are broken ? ''	1
the woman dissolved into tears again and her husband put one hand stiffly on her arm , obviously embarrassed by how his wife was carrying on .	1
mrs. hearst 's lip curled with anger and she yanked her arm out of his grip .	1
`` what was your name , dear ? ''	1
she asked crossly .	1
wara told her .	1
`` wara . ''	1
noah 's mother pronounced the foreign name and then drilled wara with her bereaved eyes , voice shaky and tight .	1
`` for your parents , leave this awful country and go home .	1
there 's nothing for you here .	1
look what comes of all this supposed 'doing good ' !	1
for the love of god , leave this terrible place ! ''	1
wara felt shaken by the woman 's emotion , and she wanted to back away , get out of this conversation , go back where she could be closer to noah .	1
she wondered briefly if the embassy had listened to alejo at all when he told them that the bus had been attacked , and if they had told the hearsts about it .	1
no one 's here from the embassy , trying to find me to get more information .	1
the hearsts seem devastated but not furious .	1
they must not know .	1
then another hand touched her arm , and she jerked around to see an athletic-looking guy with a pock-marked face and mahogany skin .	1
a crisp white dress shirt was tucked into worn jeans , and his hair was slicked back with way too much gel .	1
he addressed noah 's mother .	1
`` i 'm so sorry , ma'am .	1
you do n't know me , but my name is hector villanueva and i 'm a volunteer with the sar search and rescue team . ''	1
he paused , obviously noticing the three confused gringo faces .	1
`` i was part of the team that went down to the bus accident , '' he clarified , expression grave and serious .	1
`` this accident ? upset me so much .	1
i 've been a volunteer for ten years , but this one really got to me .	1
i 've been going to the funerals of nearly all of the victims , and i just wanted to tell you , the parents , how sorry i am . ''	1
mr. and mrs. hearst were staring blankly at the man , and wara realized with a start that they did n't understand a word he was saying .	1
she numbly translated most of what the sar volunteer had said into english .	1
mrs. hearst nodded , barely looking at the man , but noah 's father 's face had gone crimson and he lumbered forward , bearing down on hector villanueva .	1
`` now listen here , '' he growled , swiping at a drop of sweat about to run into his eye .	1
`` there 's a woman from the embassy here with us , i suppose as a babysitter , but the embassy does n't appear to have any information about anything .	1
we 've tried for days to get information about the rescue efforts , progress , anything .	1
and guess what , no one knew anything !	1
well -- - '' mr. hearst cut his tirade short for a moment as he noticed that wara was translating for the sar worker .	1
then he ranted on , `` last night , with no warning , we get a call from some missionary who knew our son that he is dead !	1
well , you were there-can you tell us what has been going on since that accident ?	1
why did n't they find our son until last night ?	1
and if they found him before , why the heck did n't anyone tell us anything ? ''	1
noah 's father 's voice cracked , and he fell silent , swiveling his gaze over to the silent coffin along the wall .	1
wara felt faint , but translated the general gist back to the man who had been there on the side of the mountain cliff .	1
looking for noah 's body among the twisted vines and jungle thorns .	1
noah 's parents wanted to know what they had found .	1
`` i ca n't do this . ''	1
she trembled from head to toe , backing away from the three others in the conversation .	1
`` i ca n't translate this , how he was ? ''	1
a tight hand clapped her on the shoulder , and wara lifted wild eyes to meet alejo 's , deadly serious and morose .	1
`` you 've been standing up too long , '' he told her in spanish , and then the grim line of his mouth softened .	1
`` i 'm going to translate for them .	1
go sit over there . ''	1
without waiting to be told a second time , wara hurriedly slipped away from the conversation that had suddenly turned gruesome and found refuge in a tan swivel chair a few feet behind noah 's parents .	1
she collapsed into it , pulling her feet up to sit cross-legged , and buried her face into her hands .	1
of course from here she could still hear everything that was said , but at least she would n't be the one to translate it .	1
wara focused on the sar worker 's spanish instead of alejo 's clipped , perfect english as he translated .	1
hector villanueva had already launched back into the conversation , seriously stating the facts to answer noah 's father 's questions .	1
he was describing the process sar , the bolivian volunteer search and rescue department , had used to scale down the rugged terrain , then systematically search for bodies .	1
they had started , of course , with the charred remains of the bus .	1
`` we were able to identify all but three of the bus ' passengers from the remains inside the bus , '' the man said , and wara cringed .	1
she closed her eyes tightly , refusing to allow her imagination to get ahead of the conversation in whether noah had been one of those burned figures trapped inside the vehicle .	1
`` verifying the identity of these bodies took until yesterday .	1
the first day we found one of franco salazar 's assistants several hundred meters uphill from where the bus came to rest .	1
she had already passed away from severe trauma .	1
the other two missing bodies were not found until yesterday around six p.m. , when the volunteers were just about to go home for the day .	1
we had been combing the area for two days , but it was n't until we reached a spot nearly a kilometer away from the bus ' exit point from the highway that we found both of them .	1
obviously they had been thrown from the bus while it was still pretty high up the mountain , to have landed so far away .	1
one of the men had been dead since approximately early monday morning , according to the autopsy , but the autopsy of the other man , your son , showed that he had passed away about twelve hours before we found the body .	1
they just called me with the autopsy results . ''	1
wara 's whole body shook and she pressed her fingers into her forehead .	1
there was a deathly silence , and then mr. hearst 's indignant voice gasped , `` are you saying that for twenty-four , no for nearly a day and a half after that accident , our son was alive down there in the jungle ? ''	1
`` yes , sir , that is what the autopsy report showed , '' hector reported , stiffening as if just now realizing that the giant man in front of him was simmering with rage .	1
`` b..b..but -- -you 're saying that because your 'search and rescue ' team did n't find him sooner , our son died ?	1
he was alive for nearly two days !	1
if you had been more competent and found him sooner , he would still be alive ! ''	1
`` no , sir , i can assure you ? ''	1
hector 's voice trailed off and he sighed .	1
`` i was there when we found him .	1
there were too many broken bones . ''	1
wara moaned and slumped forward in the chair , feeling hot tears slipping through her fingers .	1
a death-filled scene flooded her vision : noah , bloodied and broken , lying on the cold jungle floor in the dark , unable to move , with no one to help him .	1
he had died all alone .	1
but then a different picture swallowed that one up .	1
noah , lying on his back , in the middle of an emerald forest clearing , staring up at the tropical birds and butterflies flitting around the peaceful sanctuary .	1
he could n't get up , but he was singing , quietly , and the songs he sang were only between him and his god , on his way to meet him .	1
wara forced herself to swallow , then straightened in the chair .	1
the last scene of noah in the jungle was one she could live with .	1
a man had started speaking from somewhere in the room , inviting people to come take seats on the folding chairs .	1
gripping the edges of the chair with both hands to steady herself , wara rose to her feet , ready to sing a last song for noah hearst .	1
many people went up front to talk about noah , including the bolivian pastor of noah 's church .	1
the bennesons sat up front , along with the rest of the people from the mission .	1
dona filomena was there , wearing a dark pollera and cardigan with her signature gray braids .	1
even tiago showed up , nearly unrecognizable in black dress pants , a starched white dress shirt , and red weepy eyes .	1
wara sat numbly through it all .	1
eventually she realized that someone had asked her to come up and sing , and she made her way towards a folding chair off to the side , tripping once and nearly planting her face into the floor before she caught herself , grabbing another chair .	1
barely noticing her near-accident , wara sat down and pulled the guitar that was propped next to the chair onto her lap .	1
her fingers curled tightly around the neck , metal strings biting into her flesh .	1
it was noah 's honey-colored taylor .	1
they had brought it from the caf .	1
wara bit her lip , then strummed a chord .	1
the guitar was perfectly tuned .	1
she started a song she knew by the band mercy me , that began talking about how everyone says `` you '' are in a better place .	1
as the chords vibrated out of the taylor , she moved on to the chorus , singing what may have been the truest thing she had said all day : `` i 've never been more homesick than now .	1
i close my eyes , and i see your face , if home 's where my heart is then i 'm out of place , lord , wo n't you give me strength to make it through somehow , i 've never been more homesick than now . ''	1
her fingers fell across the strings one last time , sounding the last open-ended chord , and then she rested her forehead on the smooth wood of noah 's guitar .	1
after a moment , without looking at the many faces who had gathered here to remember her best friend , wara forced herself to put the guitar back in its place .	1
what she really wanted to do was sling the black guitar strap over her shoulder and walk away , never looking back .	1
eduardo was coming up front to sing something , however , and she knew he would need the guitar .	1
wara somehow managed to make it to an empty chair .	1
`` if home 's where my heart is , then i 'm out of place . ''	1
the chorus she had just sung rang in her head , even as eduardo and tobias began to sing amazing grace .	1
oh god , i can feel that so much right now .	1
why do i have to stay here any longer ?	1
if noah is with you , i want to be there too , at home .	1
i do n't think i can stay here one more minute .	1
leaning heavily forward against the metal back of an empty chair , wara 's sideways gaze fell upon alejo , standing in the back of the room , arms folded across his chest .	1
she had nearly forgotten about his existence .	1
his face was red and puffy , and he looked really , really miserable .	1
she was glad .	1
he should be miserable .	1
forever .	1
because thanks to alejo martir , i surely will be miserable forever .	1
as wara heard eduardo sing the last line of the hymn , a cold feeling crept over her chest , as if she had put on a sweater that had been sitting outside all night in a montana blizzard .	1
the feelings of anger she had just been tempted with were gone .	1
the grief seemed to be gone .	1
all wara could feel was ? nothing .	1
nothing except the desire to go home .	1
24 sea green everyone else had left the house , and alejo was left in the echoing entryway of some missionaries ' house .	1
he hunched miserably on a polished wooden chair , listening to the rhythmic tick of a clock from the kitchen off to the left .	1
wara lay curled up on a black leather sofa in a smaller family room , and she had n't said a word since the rest of the funeral attendees had left .	1
she seemed to sleeping .	1
one more hour and we can leave this place and get back to the motel .	1
alejo groaned and clunked his head against the cool plaster of the wall , envisioning red silk and painted cupids .	1
as if that 's going to be any better than being here .	1
knowing the chances were fair to good that the guys had found out about the bus victim 's funeral and would be lurking about outside , alejo had told wara they needed to wait here at the house for two hours after the rest of the people had gone .	1
then maybe they could sneak out with no one following .	1
the bennesons ' house was in an upscale neighborhood , across the street from a long , shady park .	1
pretty soon , alejo would call a radio taxi with dark windows to take them back to their hideous quarters .	1
the clock kept ticking and alejo closed his eyes , remembering the face of noah 's mother as she and her husband left with the woman from the u.s. embassy and the crew from a funeral home .	1
alejo had listened in enough to know that the hearsts were going to ship the body back to the united states for burial , and that the embassy was helping them with all the necessary arrangements .	1
wara 's haunting voice when she sang with the guitar had cut him to the heart .	1
he had n't been around so many christians since he was a kid , and the experience had been overwhelming .	1
he thought about what his father had said back at the hostal salta : noah would have forgiven you .	1
it did n't seem realistic to imagine noah just punching him in the shoulder with a , hey man , do n't worry about it .	1
it 's all good .	1
but he was supposed to believe god would forgive him , just like that ?	1
another comment wara had made sometime during their last few days flashed through his mind : `` jesus said to love your enemies . ''	1
that was very true-jesus had even said to turn the other cheek when someone hits you .	1
but did that mean standing there and watching while someone hit a helpless woman or child ?	1
god , i need help , alejo groaned out loud .	1
i 'm a mess .	1
i do n't even know how to talk with you .	1
i keep thinking i need to go wash the right way before praying and prostrate myself on the ground .	1
but here i am , without washing , not facing the right direction , just talking to you , slouched on a chair at some gringos ' house .	1
i need help .	1
but the chances of alejo meeting someone soon who could help him figure out who he was and why were pretty slim , since he and wara were in the middle of running for their lives .	1
the funeral was over , and it was time for them to leave bolivia and go to alejo 's family , so they could all start their lives over .	1
just like that .	1
alejo realized that the phone was ringing somewhere in the house , one of those annoying , electric sounds that beeped through the air in waves .	1
it finally shut up , and alejo leaned forward in his chair to peer into the room where wara had collapsed on the couch .	1
she was still there , facing the wall , huddled inside the long sleeves of her black sweater .	1
the phone started ringing again , only seconds after it stopped , and it was annoying as heck .	1
when the caller rang a third time , then a fourth , alejo 's adrenaline picked up .	1
he rose from the chair on the balls of his feet , doing a quick sweep of vision around the windows of the house .	1
nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary in the empty yard .	1
he had already made sure all the doors of the house were locked .	1
when the sixth , seventh , then eighth call came in , alejo had a sinking feeling that the caller might possibly not be someone looking for the bennesons .	1
all the phones downstairs appeared to have been disconnected for the funeral , as the only ringing came from somewhere upstairs .	1
just to be on the safe side , alejo decided to answer the phone .	1
maybe he could just give some poor gringo directions and put an end to this .	1
with a last glance at wara , he bolted up the stairs , two at a time , and across a parquet wood floor to where a cordless phone was flashing on a desk .	1
alejo marched towards the desk and snatched up the receiver , punching the talk button .	1
`` alo ? ''	1
`` oh , good , thank goodness ! ''	1
the cheerful voice on the other end appeared to be speaking around a mouthful of food .	1
`` alejo , i 'm so glad you finally did me the favor of answering , che .	1
i was beginning to think i was going to have to come over the walls and risk getting bit in the rear by that yappy white dog in there .	1
those little poodle things can be quite mean . ''	1
alejo 's blood chilled as he recognized the voice of gabriel .	1
`` che , '' he said calmly .	1
`` where are you ? ''	1
alejo moved in a crouch towards a plate window overlooking the quiet cobblestone street in front of the house .	1
a small dog , white curls graying where its belly scraped the grass , was trotting calmly around the spacious front yard .	1
nothing else in sight was moving .	1
`` oh , just outside the wall , having a snack .	1
here , let me move a little bit , there , ok , do you see me ? ''	1
a pale hand waved into alejo 's line of vision from above the thick concrete wall surrounding the house , and then all of gabriel came into view , backing up farther across the road so he was n't hidden by the wall .	1
a cell phone was plastered to one ear , and he squinted up at the window where alejo stood .	1
`` i figured it might take you guys a while to come out , '' he said with a grin , `` but i really did n't feel like waiting any longer .	1
it took me a little bit to get this number , though . ''	1
`` how 'd you know the funeral was going to be here ? ''	1
alejo needed to kill time .	1
`` facebook , '' gabriel answered , matter-of-factly .	1
`` you would n't believe how many friends this guy had .	1
makes me feel kind of bad .	1
i only have 167 . ''	1
`` so how did you know we were in here ? ''	1
was only gabriel outside ?	1
if that were the case , a dozen ways he and wara could get out of here ran through alejo 's head .	1
they surely would n't be so stupid , though , as to send only gabriel over to capture him .	1
`` my thermal imaging goggles . ''	1
gabriel 's voice was light .	1
`` there 're all kinds of poky plants in that park across the street .	1
i think they never cut the grass over there .	1
great hiding spot .	1
i can see up to 1000 meters with these things , so that was plenty close enough . ''	1
alejo saw gabriel , down below , pointing off to the park across the street , darkened with shady trees and deep green vegetation .	1
`` anyway , i saw two people hiding on the floor of a van that drove in , and figured that was n't the usual way guests arrive at funerals .	1
the rest , as they say , is history . ''	1
`` so , '' gabriel continued , blithely , `` this is the way this is going to go down .	1
benjamin is over at the hotel diplomat , where the deceased 's parents are in their room right now .	1
there 's an empty office space right across from their big plate glass window , which has the drapes wide open , and benjamin has got all the equipment set up .	1
if you do n't come out with the girl and come with me , he 'll have to take the guys ' parents out . ''	1
alejo swore under his breath .	1
now that he had chickened out about killing wara , they assumed he would n't let noah 's parents die in the middle of this mess , either .	1
and he would n't .	1
`` i 'll come out , but i ca n't let you have wara , '' he told gabriel .	1
`` i 'll go with you and talk to the khan .	1
she does n't know what 's going on .	1
leave the parents out of this-they have nothing to do with it .	1
what 's gotten into you guys ? ''	1
downstairs , something hissed , smooth wood scraping across tile .	1
alejo jerked , glancing out the window where gabriel was still on the street .	1
the sound of a door banging echoed throughout the house and alejo panicked .	1
wara was going outside !	1
the phone receiver crashed to the floor as he raced to the stairs and leaped down them , skidding at the bottom and sprinting towards the door .	1
metal grated and he saw that wara had already opened the door that led to the street and was walking out like a zombie .	1
the space between the house and the outer wall was wide , and alejo yelled , `` wara , shut the door ! ''	1
as he ran across the grass to try to reach her .	1
what was she doing ?	1
wara disappeared from view out the door , onto the street , and alejo dug up clumps of dirt racing after her .	1
he pulled up at the open door in the outer wall and took in gabriel and wara , several yards away from the house next to a white delivery truck , staring at each other .	1
gabriel seemed startled to see her , but then his eyes narrowed when he saw alejo .	1
wara turned around so her back was facing him , holding out her hands to what alejo saw was a pair of handcuffs in gabriel 's hands .	1
within two seconds , less then it would have taken for alejo to cross the space between him and his friend , gabriel had the cuffs around wara 's wrists and pushed her inside the delivery truck .	1
he slammed the heavy door shut with a clang , then alejo heard a beep as gabriel pushed something near the door latch .	1
numb , alejo started towards gabriel , unable to believe that wara had just disappeared into the truck while he just stood there .	1
`` we 're friends , che , are n't we ? ''	1
gabriel looked at alejo and shook his head sadly .	1
`` or at least we were .	1
what happened to you ? ''	1
his eyes flickered as if trying to read alejo 's expression , and then he sighed .	1
`` because we 're friends , you know that i have the door set to blow up if anyone but me , with the appropriate code , tries to open it .	1
did you hear that ? ''	1
gabriel called louder , banging on the metal side of the truck .	1
`` yes . ''	1
wara 's single word answer came flatly from inside .	1
then she added , `` do n't do anything to noah 's parents .	1
please . ''	1
`` i have to take you back now , che , '' gabriel told alejo , and his voice was really pained .	1
`` if we 're not there in another hour , benjamin gets to do his little op .	1
so do n't try anything on the way , ok ?	1
do i have to cuff you so you 're not tempted ?	1
i know you could take me out like a fly . ''	1
`` let 's go , '' alejo ground out , stalking to the passenger side of the truck and ripping open the door .	1
he slid inside and closed it , waiting for gabriel to come around and stick the key in the ignition .	1
without a word , gabriel revved up the truck , guided it around the corners of the peaceful neighborhood , then circled a round-about to merge onto a main avenue .	1
`` i did n't want to leave all of you , che . ''	1
alejo decided to start the conversation .	1
there was probably not much time until they got to wherever the khan and the rest had hidden themselves , and there was so much he wanted to say .	1
`` i always did what i believed was the right thing , what god would want .	1
so have you .	1
well this time , i could n't let her die . ''	1
alejo knew gabriel understood who he was talking about .	1
`` it was an accident that she was there .	1
the right thing was to let her live . ''	1
`` that 's where i think you are wrong , '' gabriel stated firmly .	1
`` when we were up there , i told you there could be people on-site who were unrelated to salazar , and you said , and i quote , 'then let them be collateral . '	1
unquote . ''	1
gabriel cleared his throat and jerked the steering wheel to the right , leading them along a less traveled road towards the outskirts of town .	1
`` i kind of freaked out a little , too at the idea of slitting her throat-not a pleasant idea for me , you understand .	1
but there was no other acceptable option , che !	1
you know what you 've done . ''	1
gabriel 's voice turned dark and alejo saw that he was gripping the wheel with white knuckles .	1
`` she knows everything .	1
if she 's not dead , she 'll tell .	1
we do n't even know if you have already tattled and gotten us in a heap of trouble . ''	1
`` i do n't want all of you to get into trouble , '' alejo said quietly .	1
`` yeah , well , then you should have not let your emotions get away with you and let ishmael take care of her .	1
now he 's mad as a hornet .	1
he ca n't trust you-and you 're the most important cog in the prism in the continent !	1
i do n't even think i could trust you anymore . ''	1
gabriel turned his eyes on alejo for a moment , and they flashed the anger of betrayal .	1
`` gabo , there 's a lot i have to tell you , and since this seems like it could be my last chance , knowing the khan , let me talk , ok ? ''	1
alejo sank back into the vinyl of the seat and waved one hand as he said , `` i assume you still remember our trip to the tribal area ?	1
all the bolivian guys , huddled up there near the skirmish zone ? ''	1
`` yeah , '' gabriel nodded , `` with all that ?	1
happened before i came home from pakistan , we never really talked about that .	1
i thought it was amazing , so many guys ready to follow god . ''	1
`` well i thought it was just plain wrong .	1
the khan is offering these poor guys scholarships to study , and then they 're just being used as fodder for religious wars .	1
they 're being blown to pieces , and their families will never even know where they went !	1
allah loves the poor , so do n't you think it 's wrong to offer the poor a version of islam that will only get them fired up so that someone can send them off to be mujahedeen ? ''	1
gabriel frowned , opened his mouth , then snapped it shut .	1
finally he said , `` i ca n't criticize the men who know a whole lot more about our religion and pleasing god than i do , che .	1
besides , what could be more pleasing to god then doing what those poor guys from the countryside are doing ?	1
if they stayed here , they 'd live out their lives in poverty , never making a difference at all , not knowing god .	1
but now they 're getting a chance to make their lives really count .	1
god 's going to reward them for that .	1
what 's the big deal if they die ?	1
they 're going to paradise . ''	1
alejo glanced sharply at his friend and then back at the road .	1
`` well , i ca n't just accept what others tell me about religion , because i 'm responsible to god for what i do .	1
me .	1
the last few months i 've been reading the bible , and i 've decided it 's not corrupted .	1
i 'm going to live like what it says is true , and that means following the teachings of jesus . ''	1
gabriel hit a pothole in the worn gravel road they were following and swore , not even looking at alejo .	1
`` you ca n't do that . ''	1
`` i am , '' alejo said evenly .	1
`` if you believe all those books say , you are not a muslim anymore , '' gabriel sighed .	1
adobe brick houses with scrawny chickens pecking the grass outside passed by the window , and overhead the truck was shaded by rows and rows of eucalyptus trees , lacy branches swaying in the wind .	1
gabriel shook his head and then drilled alejo with a serious stare .	1
`` you 're an apostate ? ''	1
alejo exhaled and leaned his head back into the seat .	1
`` listen , che , you are like a brother to me .	1
i wanted to tell you , but i knew if i said too much i 'd get kicked out of the prism and i might never see you again `` gabriel bit his lip and looked over at alejo , annoyed .	1
`` che , i 've heard all this christian stuff before , ok ?	1
i do n't need some man who made the insane claim that he was god to bring me close to god .	1
that 's blasphemy , anyway-i ca n't believe you would even ? whatever . ''	1
gabriel wrinkled his nose , then said , `` the quran tells us everything we need to please god .	1
and i 've been doing it all .	1
we are the best of the best , che .	1
why would we need some person to take away our sins ?	1
we are serving allah every day .	1
we 're not unbelievers who do n't follow his laws .	1
he 's got to accept me . ''	1
alejo 's heart felt heavy as he heard the last statement come out as an unsure hope .	1
a picture flashed through his mind of gabriel and himself , lounging lazily on some park bench in the plaza on a sunny coroico afternoon , licking mocha ice cream cones and grinning at the little quechua girls who sang for coins in their red plastic buckets .	1
alejo was going to lose one of his best friends .	1
the chances of alejo surviving this next encounter with the khan were slim .	1
would he ever see gabriel again ?	1
alejo 's head buzzed , and his throat tightened as he turned to stare at the cows and tall white grass whizzing by outside the van .	1
gabriel was silent , then jerked the steering wheel hard to the right , veering the delivery truck off the gravel road onto a narrower dirt path under a thick canopy of lacy trees .	1
alejo knew where they were : pairumani , a country estate that had belonged to simon patio .	1
patio had been one of the wealthiest men in the world during world war ii , making his fortune through tin .	1
this house and its gardens and lands were his retreat from his mansion in cochabamba .	1
farther along the path , a low waterfall gurgled along the edge of the road , running over mossy boulders .	1
the tree canopy suddenly dropped away , opening up to the breathtaking sight of a spacious field under a sapphire blue sky , white fluffy stalks of wild grain waving in the gentle breeze .	1
towering over the crops , two stately rows of ponderous palm trees lined a neat dirt road against a backdrop of mountain peaks , right up to an ornate metal gate that was the entrance to the pairumani estate .	1
alejo raised an eyebrow at his friend , who only turned the truck towards the gate , frowning unhappily .	1
when alejo had visited this place once before , the fields had been dotted with various volunteer students working on experimental agricultural projects sponsored by patio 's charitable foundation .	1
a few mornings a week , the caretakers of pairumani opened its gates , with permission from the patio family who now lived outside bolivia , for tourists to visit the beautiful grounds .	1
now no one was in sight .	1
the fields were empty and seemingly overgrown and abandoned ; no uniformed guard waited near the gate .	1
wait ? there is a guard here .	1
inhaling sharply , alejo recognized those glinting eyes , malicious when they needed to be .	1
sauntering over to open the gate , dressed in the olive uniform of a private security guard , was benjamin torres .	1
`` what have you guys done ? ''	1
alejo raised an eyebrow , bracing himself as gabriel floored the accelerator and the truck raced inside the gate .	1
`` oh , no one uses this place anymore , '' gabriel shrugged .	1
`` they have n't worked on those agricultural projects here in a couple of years , and the patio family is n't scheduled to come stay here for two more months .	1
you know the khan-always likes to stay in style .	1
it was either this or some dumpy hostel .	1
believe me , this is better . ''	1
gabriel glanced in the rearview mirror as benjamin shut the gate .	1
`` looks like benjamin is back .	1
he made good time . ''	1
`` the guards ? ''	1
alejo was peering out the window , looking for any sign of the rest of his team .	1
`` they 're fine , '' gabriel waved away his concern .	1
`` there were only three , and they 're tied up in a nice cozy room .	1
we bring them food .	1
they did n't see our faces , so after a few more days we 'll let them go and they 'll chalk it up to armed robbery .	1
we 'll take a few little treasures with us to make it look authentic . ''	1
alejo sighed and put one hand on the door , really anxious to get out of the car .	1
his mind raced back to wara , still handcuffed in the back of the truck , and he tried to think how he was going to get her out of this mess ? again .	1
he deserved to be here ; after all , he had broken the rules and it was only fair to have to pay .	1
panic wanted to mess with his head , however , about wara .	1
alejo tapped his foot compulsively against the floor of the truck , waiting for gabriel to park .	1
benjamin had latched the gate behind them , and he and stalin stared solemnly at the truck as it drove slowly across the manicured lawn .	1
alejo 's visions of gaining the advantage through his fighting skills died down as he saw what benjamin and stalin gripped casually by their sides .	1
two silver guns with silencers , glinting in the afternoon sun .	1
alejo 's shoulders tensed and he waited as gabriel parked the truck in a cluster of a pomegranate trees .	1
how did everything come to this ?	1
a few months ago the khan loaded me with presents and i was an honored guest in his house .	1
last thursday , the guys and i were eating brownies in the caf together , ready for another day at work .	1
images of the thousands of times alejo had prostrated himself to allah on the ground , barefoot , filled his mind , and he found his heart repeating the prayer , you are great , lord , you are great .	1
please let me honor you , oh god .	1
he heard gabriel yank the key out of the ignition and saw him reach for the door .	1
his friend hesitated , then turned to alejo with a pained look in his eyes .	1
`` i shot wara back along the road , ok ?	1
in a little while , i 'm going to have to take this truck out again .	1
ok , che ?	1
she can get out and run away . ''	1
alejo could n't help himself .	1
he grabbed gabriel 's skinny shoulders and pulled him into one of the manly bear hugs that only true latino men can share , then let him go .	1
reaching back to rip open the tiny sliding door between the back of the truck and the cab , alejo said , `` wara !	1
do n't make any noise , ok ?	1
you 're gon na be alright . ''	1
then he pushed the little door closed and climbed out of the truck to whatever was waiting for him .	1
stalin and benjamin were standing behind the truck , weapons obviously loaded and pointed casually in alejo 's direction .	1
neither of them looked particularly happy ; in fact , stalin looked downright miserable .	1
alejo nodded in greeting , then looked beyond them to where ishmael khan was waiting , sitting on a bronze-colored bench in the center of the garden , shaded by a lilac flowering tree .	1
the rest of the neatly-trimmed lawn was dotted with giant bushes that were trimmed to be absolutely round in form , like ridiculous sea-green pincushions .	1
behind the front yard , the imposing country house rose to the sky , painted cream with an opaque golden trim , windows framed by intricate colonial plaster designs .	1
a stone path began near the house , leading to a shimmering pond with emerald waters and a circular wooden hut with thatched roof in the center of the pool .	1
stately snow white swans glided on the surface of the water , skimming the scales of mammoth orange goldfish .	1
the khan was calmly flipping through a book , which alejo recognized as his bible .	1
of course ishmael had found it in alejo 's tent .	1
in light of alejo disappearing with wara , the bible must have only given the khan one more clue as to the reason for alejo 's desertion .	1
`` and the american ? ''	1
benjamin 's eyebrows were raised at gabriel .	1
gabriel waved away his concern and put one hand on his hip , crossly .	1
`` if the khan wanted her here you should have told me beforehand , because it 's a little late now .	1
she 's in lake alalay with a couple holes in her head . ''	1
`` i told you it was n't about her , '' benjamin said to stalin , shooting an amused glance at alejo .	1
`` there 's something else going on here besides just a sudden case of true love .	1
he does n't seem to be too disturbed that she 's dead . ''	1
stalin sighed , glumly , and alejo felt bad for him .	1
`` he wants to talk to you . ''	1
stalin jutted his chin in the direction of the bench where the pashto man sat , and gripped his gun tightly , still pointing it at alejo .	1
then , quieter , he hissed , `` how could you do this , che ?	1
of course you know what you 've done ? ''	1
alejo saw benjamin shake his head , face unreadable as usual , hand pointing the gun steady .	1
`` so , you left the gringo couple alone ? ''	1
alejo asked calmly , meeting his eyes .	1
`` as promised , '' benjamin 's mouth tipped up in a dry smile .	1
`` that would n't have been an extremely pleasant experience for me .	1
you 're the one who 's in trouble . ''	1
gabriel 's voice cheerily interrupted them .	1
`` i 'm coming in a sec , guys .	1
i 've got ta get my gun out of the truck . ''	1
thank god he said he 'll let her go .	1
alejo let stalin and benjamin frame him and walk him towards ishmael khan .	1
he kept up the quick pace gladly , because every step took them farther away from the white truck that held wara .	1
`` what about lzaro ? ''	1
he asked .	1
`` have n't seen him around . ''	1
`` he asked for time off , '' stalin said tightly .	1
`` he would n't admit it , but this whole thing had him upset .	1
she being his old girlfriend and all .	1
you 're an idiot to do this to us , you know that , che ? ''	1
stalin continued , whispering , sweat trickling down his temple .	1
`` you compromised everything . ''	1
then he fell silent as the three of them pulled up in front of ishmael khan , waiting with the bible across one knee and a gun and silencer resting on the other .	1
25 crimson wara was trying to muster the will to raise herself from sprawled on the truck floor in handcuffs to sitting , when a little window at the front of the truck slid open with a whoosh .	1
`` do n't move , wara , '' alejo 's voice ordered .	1
`` you 're gon na be alright . ''	1
then , just as quickly , the little door closed again , followed by two slamming vibrations of the truck as gabriel and alejo apparently left it and shut the doors .	1
her mouth was left hanging open , never having the chance to respond to alejo 's hurried instructions .	1
his words rang in her head and she let her mouth snap shut , trying to relax and not make a sound from where she lay sideways , arms twisted behind her in the cuffs .	1
wara could make out the sound of male voices outside , but they were muted and the sound did n't carry well through the metal truck .	1
she ignored the burning in her arms , watching the dented white metal door .	1
she expected the men to come bursting in any second , this time to kill her for sure .	1
the truth was , at the moment the whole idea did n't scare her as it should .	1
wara had just come from noah 's funeral , where she had seen his parents weeping over his coffin ; she was too numb to resist .	1
the voices died away , followed by a few electronic beeps .	1
something that sounded like rusting metal scraped painfully across both of the doors , and then a crack of daylight breached the darkened interior of the truck .	1
squinting , wara made out gabriel 's narrow face , framed by a halo of light .	1
he climbed into the truck , pulled the door mostly closed behind him and marched towards wara .	1
she cringed , but gabriel just squatted on the truck bed next to her and put a finger to his lips .	1
`` ssssshhhhh ! ''	1
he cautioned , throwing her a warning look .	1
then the bombshell : `` i 'm letting you go . ''	1
immediately on his feet again , gabriel strode to the back of the truck and grabbed a black duffel bag , which he unzipped .	1
wara blinked at him , wondering if he was serious .	1
she twisted her head to follow gabriel 's movement and then froze as she saw him yank a gun out of the bag .	1
hands steady , he lifted a handful of oblong bullets from one pant pocket and began stuffing them into the gun .	1
`` i ca n't believe i 'm doing this , '' he muttered , then whirled the gun 's chamber shut .	1
gabriel bent down next to her again , glanced at the truck door , then whispered crossly , `` i told them i already killed you , so do n't make any noise unless you want me-and of course , you -- - to be blown away like poor alejo is about to be . ''	1
wara 's head spun and unexplained panic filled her chest .	1
`` i 'll be back pretty soon , i assume .	1
when we come back , hide under those tarps over there if you want to live .	1
i have to leave the door open or they might suspect . ''	1
he grabbed wara 's wrists and unlocked her handcuffs .	1
`` th-thank you , '' she stammered .	1
gabriel looked down at her from where he stood , face slick with sweat .	1
`` do n't thank me .	1
alejo is in charge , but i 'm the one who put the explosives on the bus .	1
alejo does n't know how to do that stuff . ''	1
lifting his chin , gabriel turned his back on her and stomped back to the door of the truck , causing the whole vehicle to sway .	1
wara felt sick , watching him go out of the corner of her eye .	1
gabriel left only a small crack of light shining into the truck , and with the doors no longer tightly sealed , she could make out the voices from outside , louder and more intense .	1
wara crawled at a snail 's pace over to the crack of light and pressed her nose gingerly against it , trying to judge how far away she was from the other men .	1
the truck seemed to be parked under a bunch of trees , and through the leafy branches she could make out a group of four men standing maybe fifty feet away .	1
she recognized the three with guns from before -- -stalin , benjamin , and gabriel , who had just shocked her by saying he was not going to kill her .	1
lzaro was nowhere in sight .	1
alejo , in the center of them all , was the target of all of the guns ' aim .	1
sitting peacefully on a bench in the beautiful garden of pairumani sat the older guy with salt-and-pepper hair , wearing a navy cardigan sweater and pressed khaki pants , like the perfect gentleman .	1
what are we doing at pairumani ?	1
are n't there any tourists around ?	1
she had been here a few times on the weekend with friends , once with noah .	1
the little wara could see of the pristine garden surrounding the mansion was empty , except for the small group of muslim men .	1
she realized that she felt relief the martirs were out of the country , away from all this danger .	1
but then her joy tempered as she thought , if they kill alejo , who will make sure these guys do n't find nazaret 's family ?	1
wara blinked and everything in front of her shimmered .	1
god , are they really going to kill him ?	1
her hands shook and she kept them away from the open door , eyes glued to the scene unfolding outside .	1
the man with the grandfather face-ishmael-was speaking accented spanish .	1
`` stalin has been trying to tell me that this was a case of youthful indiscretion , that you were attracted to this girl ? ''	1
alejo shrugged , appearing no more concerned then if they were discussing what color to paint the foyer .	1
`` it could have been true , but that 's not what happened . ''	1
his strong voice carried across the garden .	1
`` i just did n't think it was right to kill her when god obviously let her survive .	1
it was n't what god wanted .	1
i caused something , and i 'm willing to pay the penalty for it .	1
i had to do what 's right and try to help her . ''	1
`` well , now that 's all useless anyway , since the end result is that she is dead and the rest of us have all been quite inconvenienced .	1
ah , alejo ! ''	1
ishmael 's voice sounded sad and he stood up , walking to stand directly in front of nazaret 's brother .	1
wara saw that the flash of metal in ishmael 's hand was a gun .	1
`` you were a nephew to me , my own family !	1
i took you in ? ''	1
the older man 's voice cut off as he glanced away , dramatically .	1
`` in my life i have seen so much betrayal , so many that i could not trust .	1
how can i stand this , that i ca n't even trust you , who have been like my own nephew ?	1
you must tell me the truth , son . ''	1
ishmael sighed audibly .	1
`` have you really betrayed us ?	1
have you told others about the prism ?	1
about my work ? ''	1
`` i have n't told anyone anything the least bit useful to them at all , ishmael , '' alejo replied calmly , as if trying to reason with the other men .	1
`` you are all like family to me .	1
i do n't want anything to happen to any of you .	1
all i did was try to take the girl away so you would n't kill her .	1
i simply saw a situation where i had to do what i thought was right . ''	1
this seemed to make ishmael very happy , and he raised both arms in the air , a smile plastered on his face .	1
`` excellent !	1
i do n't know why i should believe you , but i have known you since you were almost a child , alejo .	1
i believe you .	1
so then , even now , we could talk , we could find a way to bring you back .	1
you know all the ways of islam .	1
allah will forgive you . ''	1
then gabriel stepped forward , both hands steadying the gun wara had seen him take from the truck .	1
his pale face was twisted but his eyes narrowed with determination .	1
`` he 's an apostate , ishmael .	1
he told me himself .	1
he ca n't come back . ''	1
the change was astonishing .	1
wara watched as ishmael 's face crumpled , then darkened , until he was left glaring at alejo with fury .	1
whirling around , he grabbed an object from a bench nearby and the sound of ripping pages knifed through the air .	1
a book .	1
wara squinted to see better , then realized it was the same arabic bible she had seen in alejo 's tent that night .	1
the onion-skin pages were fluttering to the grass , torn by ishmael 's furious hand .	1
`` is that necessary ? ''	1
alejo asked grimly .	1
`` you would destroy a book that even the quran calls holy ? ''	1
ishmael tossed the destroyed book over his shoulder and glowered at alejo , breathing heavily .	1
`` when i heard you say you did n't mean us any harm , i assumed that my suspicions about you leaving our religion could n't be true .	1
we found this in your tent , but i told the others that it could n't mean anything . ''	1
the older man 's voice was hurt and angry .	1
`` i wo n't believe it until i hear it from your own lips .	1
are you a christian ? ''	1
`` i believe jesus is the son of god , the savior , '' alejo said .	1
stalin looked up at the sky , as if in defeat , and benjamin shook his head .	1
gabriel kept his grip tightly on his gun , staring at alejo , pallid .	1
ishmael khan took three clipped steps forward and rammed the gun he held against alejo 's forehead with an echoing click .	1
`` even with this betrayal , i wanted to take you back , alejo martir .	1
say the word , and i 'll take you back again , to be one of us .	1
say you will leave this blasphemy , that god has a son .	1
say you will return to islam and no longer follow jesus . ''	1
alejo looked back at him for a moment and then loudly said , `` no . ''	1
wara had never seen one moment pass so quickly .	1
alejo was on the ground seemingly before the shot even roared .	1
wara stared in horror at the sickly crimson mist that hung over his body , crumpled on the grass .	1
ishmael had n't even had time to lower the gun , and alejo was gone .	1
`` oh no , oh no , oh no ! ''	1
wara looked one way , then the other , whispering frantically .	1
she forced herself to focus on the scene outside again .	1
alejo martir was still sprawled on grass that was a deep crimson .	1
he was dead .	1
she had seen a man die .	1
and they are coming back here , to the truck , with his body .	1
that next thought beat urgently against her dazed brain , and she tried to focus .	1
gabriel and stalin were pulling alejo onto a gray wool blanket .	1
ishmael khan wandered off towards a more shaded part of the garden .	1
gabriel and stalin began to haul the blanket slowly across the grass towards the truck .	1
something foul tickled the back of wara 's throat and she choked down the urge to gag .	1
feeling faint , she crawled in slow motion under the canvas tarps gabriel had pointed out and tried not to move .	1
but she was shaking .	1
with every breath she felt like she was making the whole truck tremble .	1
the truck doors clanged open and someone grunted as the truck swayed .	1
they were going to put his body in here .	1
with her .	1
stalin 's voice echoed around her , crackly and breaking .	1
`` i ca n't believe this .	1
how could he be so stupid ?	1
i do n't think i can do this . ''	1
`` the worst is over , '' gabriel said , sounding quite sick as well .	1
`` it 's our job .	1
we just do what we have to do , stalin . ''	1
`` it 's alejo ! ''	1
stalin hissed , tone suggesting he wanted to yell .	1
wara heard a fist slam against the inside wall of the truck near the door .	1
the floor bounced as they stepped to the ground and both doors slammed shut , leaving the truck 's interior in utter darkness .	1
the sound of the two voices moved around the front of the truck , obviously still in heated discussion , and then the muffled sound of a door shutting and the truck roared to life .	1
gabriel , or whoever was at the wheel , was driving like a bat out of hell , nearly throwing wara into the corner of the truck every time they took a skidding turn .	1
she supposed they were driving away to get rid of the body , and the thought was horrible .	1
she had n't liked alejo much , but he was nazaret 's brother .	1
somehow , in the middle of all this mess , he had saved her life .	1
her stomach churned , complicated by the wild motion of the delivery truck .	1
she kicked the heavy tarps off her body , desperate for fresh air .	1
it was really dark inside the truck , and that was probably a good thing , because the thought of looking over and seeing alejo covered in blood next to her was terrifying .	1
but finally she could n't resist .	1
she slowly turned her head to one side and made out a still form next to her .	1
very , very still .	1
they had left him there on his stomach , eyes staring at her in the darkness .	1
his curly hair was wet and sticky and blood splattered over one ear and ran down his chin to pool on the wool blanket .	1
she shivered and turned her eyes back to the darkened ceiling , breathing deeply .	1
the sound of her gasping breaths echoed in slow motion around the interior of the truck , slow and rasping .	1
then wara 's skin crawled as she heard a low moan , and the tickle of breath across her cheek sent her scrambling into the corner , arms wrapped around her knees .	1
was someone else here ?	1
the shallow breathing continued , shuddering in slow puffs of air around the truck , and wara knew it was n't hers .	1
she was holding her breath , heart in her throat .	1
the truth came to her all of a sudden and she crashed forward onto her knees , palms spread out on alejo 's back .	1
his shoulder blades shifted upwards , then fell .	1
he was breathing .	1
she waited for what seemed like an eternity until alejo 's back rose and fell again , a rasping , choking sound that sent millipedes racing up her back .	1
he 's still alive .	1
wara threw herself down on her stomach next to alejo and whispered , `` can you hear me ? ''	1
no answer .	1
she forced herself to feel for the wound on his head , but could n't find any place where blood seemed to be spurting , nowhere that she could put pressure on the stop the bleeding .	1
`` alejo , can you hear me ?	1
it 's wara ! ''	1
she was confused to find that she was crying .	1
how could alejo have survived that ?	1
i saw him shot point-blank in the head !	1
she had to tell the guys up front .	1
alejo needed a hospital .	1
wara paused , imagining herself kicking the wall of the truck 's cab like a madwoman to get gabriel 's attention .	1
stalin does n't know i 'm alive back here , and i do n't know how badly he wants me dead .	1
and if either of them finds out alejo is alive , they could come back here and just finish the job .	1
sweat pricked wara 's armpits .	1
the vehicle spun to a skidding stop and two doors slammed .	1
wara braced herself next to alejo , waiting like a deer caught in the headlights for the truck doors to open .	1
time was up for any kind of decision ; they were coming back here .	1
a scraping of metal , then the truck filled with shafts of light , filtered through shadowy eucalyptus branches waving over the truck outside .	1
wara saw that they were stopped near the side of the road , still in the countryside .	1
the two guys peered into the truck , expressions grim .	1
`` he 's still alive ! ''	1
wara blurted out , holding out a hand towards alejo and realizing it was smeared with blood .	1
she scrubbed her hand frantically on her black pants .	1
`` he 's your friend !	1
take him to the hospital .	1
there 's still time ! ''	1
gabriel regarded alejo with pinched lips ; stalin 's mouth gaped open , taking in first alejo lying there , then wara next to him .	1
`` i told stalin that you were back here , '' gabriel clipped .	1
`` he 's a nice guy anyway , kind of a pushover .	1
i thought maybe he would help me .	1
he noticed that alejo was still alive on the ground at pairumani . ''	1
`` thank god he 's still ? we 've got to hurry , wara . ''	1
stalin 's voice was heavy .	1
`` we 're taking him to univalle hospital-it 's close to the lake where we 're supposedly leaving him , and then the khan is waiting for us at the airport .	1
we 've got to hurry , or he 'll suspect .	1
and it 'll be too late . ''	1
stalin blanched and turned away from the sight of his friend covered in blood .	1
`` wara . ''	1
gabriel snapped his long fingers , calling her attention back .	1
`` when we get to univalle , we ca n't stay .	1
we 're going to drop him and you and get away as fast as we can .	1
you 've got to run , ok ?	1
invent something to tell the doctors , but do n't tell them the truth .	1
if you tell anyone about us , the authorities and media will find out .	1
and if they find out , the khan and everyone else will know you and alejo are not dead .	1
you understand . ''	1
gabriel had been speaking quickly but concisely .	1
he suddenly slowed down and his shoulder sagged .	1
`` please help him .	1
he did this for you . ''	1
gabriel waved his hand unsteadily at alejo 's lifeless form , then looked back at wara once more with tortured eyes .	1
`` hurry up ! ''	1
stalin said loudly , and then slammed one of the doors .	1
the other reverberated like thunder as it too was shut heavily , and then footsteps running on gravel sounded outside .	1
with a gentle jerk , the truck sprinted back into motion , towards cochabamba and life for alejo .	1
an eternal fifteen minutes or so dragged by as wara braced herself in the pitch darkness , trying not to be thrown on top of alejo by the urgent driving maneuvers of his friends .	1
she left a palm on alejo 's back .	1
finally , the delivery truck careened around a last corner and came to a screeching halt , causing wara to bang a shoulder against the metal side .	1
running footsteps , and then the doors to the truck were opened , letting in florescent light from an overhead street lamp .	1
the sun had already disappeared , and the sky was deep blue .	1
`` univalle , '' stalin 's scratchy voice said , face etched with stress .	1
he and gabriel leaped into the truck and began to carefully pull the blanket with alejo 's prostrate form towards the door .	1
`` still breathing ? ''	1
stalin asked wara .	1
she nodded and scrambled up after them , leaping out onto what she saw was the sidewalk of the hospital .	1
she had heard of this university teaching hospital , located near the poorer south of the city .	1
five tan , modern-looking stories rose out of an adobe house neighborhood , and the truck had stopped right in front of the main entrance .	1
no one was visible at this time of night , but a guard shack just inside the entrance told wara that someone might soon appear to see what was going on in front of the hospital .	1
gabriel and stalin heaved alejo and blanket to the ground as gently as they could , then whirled to face wara .	1
`` go with god , '' stalin muttered , covering his eyes with his hands .	1
then he dashed to the passenger side of the truck .	1
gabriel was already half in the driver 's side , but leaned back to whisper , `` go !	1
run ! ''	1
the truck pealed away in a cloud of dust , rounding the corner at the end of the short street at break-neck speed .	1
alejo 's ribcage rose shakily , then he gagged and shuddered into the wool blanket .	1
here in the dim street light , wara could see the blood already starting to dry , plastered along one cheek , matting his hair .	1
his eyes had closed .	1
a hospital guard in a navy uniform stepped questioningly toward her from the shack , eyeing the form on the ground .	1
wara ran .	1
`` please , help me ! ''	1
she cried to the guard , then ran past him into the near-empty waiting room where she saw a door with large red letters : emergencias .	1
`` help , somebody help , please ! ''	1
yelling to anyone in sight , wara pleaded for help for the man who had caused noah 's funeral .	1
26 pale blue the pillow beneath her head was prickly with feathers , the pale blue cotton blanket meant to be soft and comforting .	1
but wara shivered on the narrow hospital bed all night , sleeping barely a wink between nocturnal nurse visits and the constant beeping of the blood pressure machine .	1
alejo was alive .	1
he was lying nearly motionless on the other bed in the hospital room , chest faintly rising and falling under a matching pale blue blanket .	1
a thick ream of gauze was plastered around his head , covering the wound where the doctors claimed the bullet had narrowly missed his brain .	1
but that was impossible ; wara had seen the gun pressed point-blank against the center of alejo 's forehead , then fire .	1
he should n't be alive .	1
and he might not be for much longer .	1
`` for now your fianc is stable , but in a coma , '' dr. ortega had told her seriously last night , wadding used latex gloves in the pocket of his lab coat after emerging from the emergency room .	1
remembering gabriel 's ominous words of warning not to let anyone find out she and alejo were still alive , wara had told the doctor she was engaged to the man who 'd been shot in the head .	1
they were tourists here from the u.s. , and had been robbed at gunpoint in the country near pairumani .	1
dr. ortega looked at her over gold-rimmed glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose with thick , hairy fingers .	1
`` we 're not out of the woods , yet , by any means .	1
the bullet 's shock waves could have serious repercussions .	1
i 'm going to be honest with you .	1
if your fianc would need brain surgery , there 's no way we can do it here .	1
an airlift to chile or argentina would take too long .	1
stay with him tonight in the extra bed in the room ; if he 's going to pull through we should know by the morning . ''	1
and now it was morning ; crisp white light filtered in through the blue checked curtains of the hospital room .	1
a matronly nurse in a tri-cornered hat and thick stockings was shoving a glass thermometer under alejo 's tongue and smoothing the covers over his shoulders .	1
as if he would have been able to mess them up somehow ; nazaret 's brother was as motionless as he had been sprawled there on the ground at pairumani .	1
but he 's still alive .	1
dr. ortega had said that if alejo made it til the morning , his chances were better .	1
wara sat up groggily on the bed and turned toward him , eyes stinging as she took in the bloodied bandage above one closed eye .	1
i have to call the martirs , she realized .	1
the idea brought a new chill of shock .	1
how could she tell them what had happened , that the son they had just found as a killer had been shot and could die ?	1
and that she had seen the whole thing ?	1
feeling sick , wara ignored the matronly nurse with clogs and staggered wordlessly into the hall .	1
clean white tiles spread before her , and the air was ripe with the scent of clorox and chamomile tea cooling on breakfast trays .	1
wara stumbled to the silver elevator and punched a button to head down , desperate to get some fresh air .	1
in the pocket of her black pants , she fingered the fat wad of boliviano bills she had removed from alejo 's pants before the nurses carried him into the emergency room .	1
it should be enough to last for awhile ; for sure it was enough to make a call to the martirs ' cell phone in lima .	1
the doors dinged open on the main floor , but as soon as wara 's eyes hit the lobby she nearly doubled over , remembering the scene last night when she ran across the tiles screaming for help .	1
without stopping , wara did a one eighty and headed down the hall , towards the back of the hospital and away from the lobby .	1
plastic olive chairs lined the scuffed walls , filled with women in polleras and children licking suckers .	1
wara eyed them all blankly , forcing herself to put one foot in front of the other , really hoping there was going to be a back exit to this hospital .	1
and outside the exit , some quiet , grass-covered spot where she could curl up and wail , possibly until next week .	1
it was still early ; the call to the martirs was going to have to wait just a little bit more .	1
the creaky voice calling to her in quechua took her totally unaware .	1
`` imajnaya kasanki ?	1
how are you , wara ? ''	1
wara planted her flip-flops in the center of the hall and whirled around , eyes wild .	1
who knew her here ?	1
she was supposed to be dead .	1
the navy cardigan sweater and thin gray braids were nothing out of the ordinary in this row of quechua women awaiting the doctor , but the crinkled black eyes regarding wara immediately flashed familiar .	1
doa filomena , the elderly lady who worked at caf amara !	1
wara felt her shoulders slump with relief and she took the few faltering steps over towards the older woman , overwhelmed to see someone from her old life .	1
her old life , before the trip to coroico , before disaster .	1
wara slowly leaned forward to grasp doa filomena 's forearm , mumbling the usual quechua greeting .	1
the woman smiled , dispersing a legion of crow 's feet across her copper cheeks .	1
`` i have been needing to have some tests done for a while , '' she was saying in quechua , `` and since the caf is closed today i am taking advantage of the time . ''	1
wara swallowed hard .	1
caf amara , vestiges of another dimension .	1
`` the caf is closed ? ''	1
she repeated .	1
her voice faded to a whisper as she asked , `` why ? ''	1
`` you do n't know ? ''	1
doa filomena 's rheumy eyes flickered , then she cocked her head to one side .	1
`` of course you know !	1
they said you were on the bus as well , that bus that had the accident .	1
this whole week we prayed for you , and that boy .	1
we prayed for you so much .	1
what am i thinking , how could i forget that !	1
they said that you had been found and that you were all right .	1
but then yesterday i went to work , to peel potatoes and make the humintas , and they said that the caf was closed until next week , because they found that poor boy had died and gone to glory . ''	1
wara 's words stuck in her throat .	1
i ca n't talk about noah , or i 'm going to throw myself into her arms and cry .	1
her knees trembled beneath her .	1
and then she heard herself say something she never would have expected .	1
`` doa filomena , can you please pray for another friend of mine ? ''	1
the word 'friend ' was spoken rather tightly .	1
`` he was shot in the head .	1
the doctors think he might not live . ''	1
`` oh , that is serious ! ''	1
doa filomena shook her head slowly , thin gray braids scratching her worn sweater .	1
`` we must pray for this poor boy , too .	1
sometimes , when i am not working , i come here to the hospital to pray for people .	1
and if i can not come , i will remember to pray for your friend at church . ''	1
wara felt some kind of relief that filomena would probably be waving her hands around and praying for alejo , because right now , she could n't .	1
all she could do was sit there and watch him , to see if he would live or die .	1
fighting back the bitterness stinging her throat , wara said goodbye to doa filomena and made a beeline for the back door of the hospital .	1
an ample concrete square shaded by a balcony preceded the hospital 's delivery area , currently completely empty .	1
filomena 's words echoed through wara 's head : `` they found out that poor boy had died and gone to glory . ''	1
barely stifling a cry of grief , wara flopped to the ground behind a huge clay planter and curled into a ball .	1
sometime in the afternoon , wara forced herself up from the ground .	1
she wandered the dusty neighborhood and called the martirs on the brand new cell phone alejo had bought for them .	1
she could n't call them on her own new cell phone , because the thing only worked for local calls .	1
by the time she left the viva call center across from univalle , dusk had darkened to full-blown night .	1
few people passed the hospital on the unlit sidewalks .	1
wara sighed deeply and headed across the street to the hospital , resigned to spend one last night here before joining the martirs in lima .	1
yes , she felt bad for alejo ; he was up there all alone , life hanging in the balance .	1
but he was n't hers to care for , not by a long shot .	1
she needed some time , needed to be close to people she actually liked .	1
the roll of red boliviano bills she had pilfered from alejo were more than enough to make it to lima .	1
with her dark coloring , she 'd likely make it across the border on the bus without showing id .	1
she had also called her parents again from the call center , and they would wire money to lima for her and arrange for a plane ticket back to the u.s. home .	1
but not really .	1
this had been her home .	1
i loved this city .	1
i never wanted to leave .	1
but now cochabamba seemed full of unknown stalkers and haunted memories .	1
for the first time since she arrived in bolivia five years ago , wara wanted to go home .	1
chest still tight with emotion , wara exited the elevator upstairs and turned towards the room she shared with comatose alejo .	1
the halls were dim and empty and a faint , urgent beeping drilled the walls .	1
from the direction of alejo 's room .	1
wara swallowed hard , just as the buxom nurse from this morning pushed past her , practically tearing up the tiles in her white clogs .	1
wara froze , then hurried after her with clipped steps , as the nurse dove into the open door where wara had left alejo .	1
she ducked inside to find alejo convulsing on the bed and the blood pressure machine going wild .	1
dr. ortega had his back to wara , punching a syringe into the plastic of alejo 's iv bag .	1
five or six nurses in white were framing the bed , grim and sober .	1
every single set of eyes flickered to wara as she entered , and none of the gazes were friendly .	1
`` what 's happening ? ''	1
she asked stupidly , knowing they all must hate her for disappearing the whole day while her fianc was hovering between life and death .	1
`` he 's dying ! ''	1
the nurse with the clogs snapped , then turned back to alejo .	1
`` it 's the swelling . ''	1
dr. ortega 's face shone slick with sweat above a bushy black beard .	1
`` it 's gotten worse , making him convulse .	1
his heart 's racing .	1
it 's like i told you , seorita .	1
the only way to relieve the swelling is to operate .	1
we ca n't do that here . ''	1
wara wandered closer , ignoring the cool glances of the nurses .	1
alejo had stopped shaking and lay flat on the bed , face the color of white clay .	1
`` he 's dying ? ''	1
she repeated , moving so close one hand touched the edge of the bed near alejo 's elbow .	1
`` the bullet did n't enter his brain , '' the doctor said , speaking loudly over the frantic beep of alejo 's heart rate .	1
`` but the impact still caused this swelling .	1
it 's much worse than we thought .	1
his heart ca n't keep this up much longer .	1
i 'm sorry . ''	1
wara did n't even look at the doctor , but her face crumpled as she watched alejo .	1
i should leave .	1
just leave .	1
i do n't have to watch this .	1
but her heart surged to her throat , vibrating with what she realized was compassion .	1
she clutched the bed sheet with white knuckles .	1
alejo 's heart rate accelerated further and his back arched .	1
and then his eyes flew open , leaving wara absolutely shocked , staring into a sea of hazel .	1
he was sitting , suddenly , gasping and leaning forward onto the pale blue blanket .	1
the monitor 's beeping dove from a constant beep to deep electronic thuds .	1
and stayed that way .	1
dr. ortega had flown to the bedside and was leaning over alejo 's shoulder , trying to support him .	1
behind the gold-rimmed glasses , the doctor 's eyes were round and about to pop .	1
`` his heart rate 's normal , '' he stammered .	1
`` where did it ? what happened to the tachycardia ? ''	1
the nurses had drawn back and were gaping at alejo sitting up on the bed .	1
and then they jumped .	1
because alejo grinned .	1
at wara .	1
it was weak and lop-sided , and looked out of place on his pale face .	1
but the smile caused his eyes to spark , and he glued his gaze on wara , who gawked back at him , knee propped against the side of his bed .	1
`` you ! ''	1
he croaked .	1
then coughed and tried another grin .	1
`` he told me i would n't remember your name .	1
does n't matter .	1
they 're coming for us .	1
two of them .	1
and he said we 're just supposed to go , and do whatever they say .	1
come with me ! ''	1
and then the grin faded and alejo hunched farther over , as if just now feeling the pain traveling down the nerve pathways from his head .	1
`` what hospital is this ? ''	1
he moaned , leaning over onto his knees with head in his hands .	1
`` i remember everything .	1
i ca n't believe i 'm here . ''	1
the nurses rushed towards him , firm hands admonishing the patient to lie back down .	1
wara forced her mouth to shut and backed up a few feet from the bed .	1
she ripped her gaze away from alejo towards the doctor , who was still watching wide-eyed and incredulous .	1
`` i ca n't believe ? i was sure he was ? dying . ''	1
as if realizing he had just said that out loud , dr. ortega snapped his mouth shut and rubbed his temple .	1
`` this is really unusual .	1
we 'll have to run some more tests .	1
i 'd say we 're not out of the woods yet , after that little speech our patient just made .	1
he 's obviously delirious .	1
it 's to be expected with the brain trauma . ''	1
delirious .	1
of course .	1
`` they 're coming for us ? ''	1
that had sounded like a line out of terminator .	1
a skinny nurse butted into wara 's line of sight , cutting off the conversation with the doctor .	1
`` doctor , '' she clipped nervously .	1
`` the patient he ? ca n't see . ''	1
wara blinked , staying where she was as dr. ortega moved towards alejo and tried to check his sight .	1
`` you ca n't see ? ''	1
the doctor asked with concern .	1
alejo was lying still on the rumpled pillow , eyes opened narrowly .	1
`` i ca n't see anything , '' he answered .	1
`` there you go . ''	1
dr. ortega turned his head towards wara .	1
`` it 's still the swelling .	1
considering the loss of sight and that delirious talk , i 'm going to have the lab come up and do some more tests right away . ''	1
but he looked right at me .	1
when he woke up , wara thought , stunned .	1
that grin , half-crazed but out of his mind with delight about something .	1
he knew she was there .	1
and now he could n't see .	1
`` it 's late , '' the doctor told wara .	1
`` why do n't you try to get some rest , while we draw some blood for the tests . ''	1
everyone shuffled out into the hallway , leaving wara alone with alejo , lying still and pale in the bed .	1
staring at the ceiling and seeing nothing .	1
`` get some rest , '' the doctor says .	1
tomorrow could n't come fast enough .	1
wara needed to escape to lima .	1
27 sapphire gabriel shara forced himself to eat breakfast that morning purely out of habit .	1
his stomach was full of butterflies with razor wings and his hands tingled as he sat at the table near the large picture window in the kitchen .	1
he was waiting for manuel , and manuel was not coming .	1
gabriel realized that the hot water in his ceramic mug was getting cold , and he distractedly unscrewed the red plastic lid of the nescafe jar and scooped a generous heap of instant coffee into the water .	1
he added two tiny spoons of sugar and a stream of cream , stirring it around without thinking .	1
a tightly-sealed bag of crusty marraqueta bread had been delivered this morning and was sitting on the middle of the white lacquer table .	1
gabriel extracted one of them , sliced it open with a serrated knife from the table , and began to spread regia margarine and strawberry jam on each side .	1
as he bit into the chewy , warm bread , the thought crossed his mind : these are exactly like the ones my mom used to make , in the clay oven in the back yard .	1
gabriel 's mouth twitched into a smile at the image of his fashionable , upper-class mother , standing in the backyard in a pink apron and huge oven mitts , waiting for the crust of the marraquetas to reach just the right texture so she could snatch them from the steaming mouth of the oven in the corner of their backyard .	1
the shara family had maids and servants to do every kind of manual labor , but baking bread had been his mother 's hobby .	1
gabriel thought it was in her blood , passed down from her arab ancestors who had baked flat bread in outdoor ovens in palestine .	1
he sighed deeply at the memory of his mom .	1
it stunk that she could n't know about his work , and especially about the assignment gabriel was on today .	1
it was such an honor that the khan had thought of him for this job .	1
his mom would be so proud .	1
but she would probably never find out .	1
gabriel frowned in frustration and slowly chewed his bread , then glanced nervously out the window , watching for manuel .	1
gabriel was waiting in a large , newly-constructed house on a high slope at the north of cochabamba , one of many rented by the khan 's foundation .	1
no one else was here besides gabriel , and that fact was beginning to make gabriel sweat .	1
he swore silently as he took a swig of nescafe and stood up again to try to see over the concrete wall surrounding the house and down the hill where a car could be coming up the cobblestone street .	1
nothing .	1
the morning was silent , except for the sound of a few song birds flitting around the coral and white flowering trees in the neighborhood .	1
where was manuel ?	1
after the disastrous scene with alejo at pairumani and the subsequent rush to univalle , gabriel and stalin had made it just in time to the jorge wilstermann airport to meet benjamin and ishmael .	1
until the moment that the men were to check in for their flight to asuncion , where they would meet lzaro after his three-day sabbatical and regroup , only ishmael had known that gabriel would be staying behind .	1
as he clapped all his friends on the back good-bye , gabriel had casually explained that he had a contract for a job , and would meet them in asuncion after the weekend , inshallah .	1
allah willing .	1
okay , so gabriel would n't carry out the actual mission today , of course .	1
that was where manuel came in .	1
gabriel was the mastermind behind the whole thing , providing all the technical support .	1
the client who had hired him was going to pay him a cartload of money .	1
last night gabriel had stayed up much later than he should have , playing the violin much too fast while dreaming what he would buy for ambrin with the money .	1
he was thinking maybe a trip to europe for the honeymoon , because what girl did n't want to go to europe ?	1
in two more months , ambrin would graduate from nursing school and ishmael had said the wedding could happen after that .	1
the whole idea was enough to make gabriel downright delirious .	1
but he really did n't feel at peace .	1
of course he wanted to marry her !	1
but that was just the problem .	1
allah had given gabriel back his life that night in peshawar when his throat had been slit .	1
what right did he have to just marry ambrin and go on honeymoon to paris and live happily ever after ?	1
the world was full of people suffering , their daily lives full of misery .	1
a good example was the people of palestine , where his grandparents had lived before immigrating to bolivia .	1
he probably still had relatives there , whom he had never met , trapped in what many considered the world 's largest jail .	1
conditions there were abject poverty , as the palestinians had been forced off their land by the israelis and left with nowhere to go .	1
they belonged to no country , thus had no passport and could never leave that place to study overseas or work .	1
and in palestine , there was no work .	1
would n't allah be more than a little mad if gabriel just married ambrin and sat around drinking coffee with her in the mornings and laughing about all their kids ' cute little antics ?	1
the thought caused gabriel 's stomach to churn .	1
what if allah was n't pleased with his decision to live out his own desires and marry ambrin ?	1
what if he would n't let him into paradise ?	1
the taste of the fresh bread soured in gabriel 's mouth and he gulped down the last inch of coffee , then glanced once more at the window .	1
the brick-colored stones of the street were still silent .	1
he carried his dishes over to the sink , where later they would be washed by someone the khan hired to keep this place up .	1
he dropped the margarine and cream off in the refrigerator , carefully tied up the bread in its bag with a perfect little knot .	1
all the rooms of the huge house were absolutely silent , and the slapping of gabriel 's bare feet across the shiny black tiles echoed loud .	1
he pulled a cell phone out of his jean pocket and punched in the number for manuel , holding his breath .	1
he 'll probably answer and say that he is just pulling up to the gate any minute .	1
he would n't be late for this , would he ?	1
not after all the time we 've spent .	1
manuel choque 's family lived in a one-room hut of adobe out in the mountains around potosi his father had not been home since he was two .	1
somehow , while packed into a classroom of seventy kids out in the countryside , he 'd been picked out as having musical talent .	1
manuel had been given a full scholarship to attend the iranian-bolivian conservatory , founded five years back in cochabamba .	1
the short , swarthy seventeen-year old was now a beautiful classical violin player , as well as a devoted muslim .	1
when he was n't studying , he made a small amount of cash playing at concerts and parties .	1
he also took occasional jobs playing at upscale restaurants , who requested musicians from the conservatory .	1
today , beginning at 12:00 , manuel was to play at a luncheon .	1
on his way to the job , manuel was to stop here at the house , to take care of some vital matters with gabriel , who had prepped him for this day in several important meetings .	1
manuel was supposed to arrive at 9:30 .	1
as the cell phone kept ringing , gabriel pulled the phone away from his ear to check the time .	1
9:42 .	1
how could he be late , today of all days ?	1
there was so much to do .	1
manuel knew what today meant .	1
he 'd said he wanted his life to mean something .	1
sighing crossly , gabriel hung up and redialed .	1
as the ringing began again , he padded across the wide entryway into a room that lay behind a heavy wooden door .	1
he pushed it open and strode over to a thick table , glancing for the hundredth time that morning at his creations from the past twenty-four hours of work .	1
in the corner of the room , boxes of explosives and electronics were scattered , like a kids ' legos dumped out onto the tiles .	1
the contents of gabriel 's tool boxes were sprawled across the dusty black tile of the floor , signs that a madman/half-genius had been at work , putting together things from raw ingredients with the inspiration of an artist .	1
but the most important item for today 's mission was laid out on a crude wooden workbench , awaiting the arrival of manuel .	1
gabriel 's violin was also resting on sapphire velvet in its case on a clean work table .	1
he almost choked up , seeing the instrument and remembering last night , how he 'd played for ambrin and dreamed of europe .	1
i 've slept in so many strange places like this house , that are home to no one ; full of generic dishes , fresh instant coffee , and beds that are always mysteriously made up with clean sheets by some unknown hand .	1
but as long as i 'm with my violin , it feels like home .	1
things are n't so bad .	1
gabriel pressed his lips together as the cell continued ringing , now for the fifth time .	1
he felt a little faint as it occurred to him that manuel was not coming .	1
no !	1
how could he do this ?	1
how could he not understand how important this is ?	1
ok , yes , it 's a little scary .	1
but he said he was prepared !	1
everything depends on him !	1
gabriel slammed a fist into the wooden doorframe and leaned against it , breathing heavily .	1
manuel , how dare you chicken out on me !	1
there was n't much time , and he really needed to think .	1
the only way near the targets was as the musical entertainment , sent by the conservatory .	1
and the iranian-bolivian conservatory had lined up manuel , per gabriel 's instructions .	1
i ca n't believe this !	1
this is so important-i was so sure this is what allah wanted !	1
how can we let this opportunity slip away , just because manuel did n't show ?	1
we are so close !	1
but without him , there 's no way to get close enough to the targets .	1
gabriel blinked as his eyes fell upon the honey-colored wood of his violin , resting on top of sapphire velvet .	1
of course there 's a way .	1
i can replace manuel , tell them the conservatory sent me .	1
when they hear me play , there wo n't be a single complaint .	1
for a moment he felt a little woozy , the only thing holding him back a memory of deep , sapphire blue eyes framed by a lilac veil in a beautiful garden in pakistan .	1
but there really was no other way .	1
steeling himself , gabriel knelt , then prostrated himself on the ground , feeling dirty and unclean , knowing he had not washed himself properly for prayer .	1
if only allah could forgive him this one time , in this hour of greatest need .	1
unbidden , the scene from pairumani flashed through his mind : alejo , who had always cared about him , dead because he had refused to return to allah .	1
the bile of that betrayal threatened to rise up gabriel 's throat , along with crazy sorrow over losing his friend .	1
but greater than that was the concern that squeezed gabriel as he remembered his own betrayal : he had lied to the khan and let that girl go , out of pity .	1
she could cause all kind of damage to the cause of allah .	1
and allah knew all about it .	1
gabriel turned his hands up towards heaven , supplicating , then closed his eyes .	1
there was no more time .	1
he waited there on the floor , hoping for wisdom , feeling the burden of pleasing allah pressing him into the ground .	1
then he clenched his jaw , sure , and climbed to his feet , staring at the workbench .	1
i should never have trusted manuel to do this .	1
i will go .	1
with deliberation , gabriel unbuttoned his shirt and threw it on the floor , feeling the chill of the morning air on his bare chest .	1
time to get dressed .	1
the violin would be going with him , just as it always did to every place he called home .	1
this would n't be so bad .	1
28 fiery wara woke in the morning to luke-warm anise tea on a breakfast tray next to her bed .	1
she slit her eyes and saw alejo martir sitting cross-legged on the other bed in the hospital room , staring at nothing , wearing sweat pants under a blue plaid hospital gown .	1
she really did n't want to open her eyes .	1
alejo could n't see .	1
last night the doctor had ordered a lot of tests , but of course it was because of the gun shot to the head .	1
it was unbelievable he was even alive .	1
the only thing that convinced wara to sit up in bed was remembering that today she would get away from this place and be on her way back to see the martirs , then to the u.s. she tried to swing her legs over the side of the bed but her head spun like a ballerina practicing pirouettes .	1
her eyes felt like sandpaper and her nose still felt like it was stuffed with cotton .	1
thank god , dr. ortega said it was n't actually broken .	1
wara slapped at the cooling mug of tea on her tray and gulped it down , shuddering at the sickly sweet brew .	1
alejo heard the clatter of ceramic on the table and turned towards her , expression pained .	1
she needed to say something to him .	1
after all , this was good-bye .	1
or good riddance .	1
`` are you ? are you ok ? ''	1
she asked tentatively .	1
of course he was n't ok .	1
he was blind and rather out of his mind .	1
wara frowned and slumped back into the headboard , remembering the silly grin of yesterday and alejo 's rambling about two something coming for us .	1
had it been two people ?	1
or aliens ?	1
alejo sighed and tried to smile towards her , but it was a sad smile .	1
`` the tests from yesterday show the swelling is down .	1
dr. ortega came in while you were sleeping .	1
he could n't believe it .	1
guess it 's supposed to take three or four days for the swelling to die down .	1
i still ca n't see though .	1
for that , he said just wait and see .	1
he said maybe my sight 'll come back .	1
from the way he said it , i think he 's just trying to be nice . ''	1
wara winced and forced herself to eat two round maria cookies from the white china plate next to the anise tea .	1
she was wiped out , barely keeping herself together .	1
what was she supposed to say ?	1
`` i 'm sorry this happened to you ? ''	1
`` it sure was awful watching your blood splatter everywhere , and i 'm sorry all your friends just sat by and watched ? ''	1
she had already talked with alejo a tiny bit last night , when just the two of them were left alone in the room after all the lab tests .	1
he remembered being shot and was obviously relieved that wara was alive and well .	1
wara filled him in on how stalin and gabriel had saved his life by dropping them off here at univalle .	1
there really was n't much else to say , was there ?	1
oh yeah .	1
`` i 'm going to lima , to see your family , '' she announced , watching his reaction while breaking another maria cookie up into tiny little bits .	1
`` tonight .	1
yesterday i found out the bus is leaving at six . ''	1
alejo 's face was impassive as he said he agreed with her decision .	1
wara slowly fed herself bites of cookie , willing the day to go by quickly .	1
they spent the next three hours watching tv .	1
or listening to tv , in alejo 's case .	1
the afternoon news began by the time a nurse brought a late lunch of white rice and chicken .	1
alejo fumbled with his fork at his plate , then froze and snatched the remote off his lap , stabbing buttons to turn up the volume .	1
`` look ! ''	1
he ordered , straining to hear the blaring voice of a female announcer .	1
wara turned her eyes to the small tv and nearly spit out a mouthful of sticky rice at the sight .	1
it was a building on cochabamba 's prado avenue , and it was burning .	1
alejo was leaning towards the television , knuckles squeezing the life out of the remote .	1
`` ? at around 12:30 today , '' the announcer was saying .	1
`` there have been reports of an explosion , followed by these images of fiery destruction you are now seeing at the hotel diplomat . ''	1
the screen cut to the picture of burning building again , towering over the busy prado avenue , flames licking the clouds .	1
boiling black smoke poured towards heaven .	1
wara gaped at the tv , not able to believe that the sleek hotel she had passed hundreds of times was now this burning wreck .	1
noah 's parents had stayed there , but were scheduled to leave the night following the funeral .	1
wara felt sure they had n't stuck around a single minute longer than necessary .	1
on the news they said it was an explosion .	1
she cut her eyes over to alejo , whose lips had condensed into a grim , pale line .	1
the female announcer was back again , in a low-cut mauve suit coat and braided gold earrings that hung to her shoulders .	1
smoky eyeliner made her eyes pop from a flawlessly tan face with salmon-colored cheeks .	1
`` many of the hotel guests , '' she continued gravely , `` were able to escape the building through stairs at the back , and the hotel bar and restaurant seems to be the hardest hit .	1
while we will have to wait for a final count , there is sure to be a great number of lives lost in this tragedy .	1
initial estimates for the death toll are between sixty and seventy . ''	1
wara 's stomach clenched and she saw the silver fire again , spinning over her head as the bus hurdled down the ravine , taking noah with it .	1
she staggered to her feet , bumping the lunch tray and sending cool tea splashing over the rice .	1
i 've got to get out of here , she thought in a daze .	1
even the bus station was sounding preferable now than staying here and watching this .	1
the news reporter was receiving a note from an off-screen hand and continuing in all her mauve , low-cut glory .	1
she drew back and frowned at the small note , then raised dark eyes to the camera .	1
`` we are just receiving word that we have confirmation of the identities of two of the men who were killed in the hotel diplomat this afternoon .	1
their names will be released later , but we do know they are a deputy minister in israel 's ministry of defense and the israeli ambassador to the united states . ''	1
wara 's eyelids fluttered as alejo muttered under his breath .	1
he did not sound happy .	1
but the news story was n't over yet .	1
`` the israeli men had come to bolivia for negotiations with the government to reopen diplomatic relations .	1
bolivia and israel have had no diplomatic relations since 2008 , when president evo morales cut off relations over the actions of israel in the gaza strip during the 2008-2009 war .	1
israel has stated that the nature of the explosion at the hotel diplomat is believed to be consistent with that of a suicide bomber , '' the young news reporter faltered a moment , and then looked at the camera , puzzled , `` and that a team of experts from tel aviv will be sent to examine the remains of the scene , to arrive at their own conclusions about what happened here in this very tragic situation . ''	1
alejo 's face was drawn and severe .	1
he knew about this , did n't he ?	1
who else would do something like this ?	1
`` did you ? did you do this ? ''	1
she stammered , eyes searching his even though she knew he could n't see her .	1
`` i know nothing about this , '' he stated each word slowly and clearly .	1
but it was obvious that something about the bombing had him upset .	1
wara lowered herself back onto her bed shakily .	1
she yanked the blanket over her head and curled up in the bed , trying to block out the sounds of the news reports about flames and death .	1
29 turquoise the bus station was packed , a writhing mass of bodies and battered suitcases .	1
wara filed outside through the appropriate gate , trying not to hyperventilate at the sight of the red double-decker bus she was supposed to board .	1
steady , she reminded herself .	1
this is n't the same bus .	1
this is your ticket to the martirs .	1
she climbed up the bus steps and easily found seat 22b , weak-kneed with relief that it was nowhere near where she and noah had sat on the bus from coroico .	1
wara smoothed her finger over noah 's ring , then leaned back into her seat and closed her eyes .	1
she had left alejo sitting morosely on the hospital bed .	1
he had refused to say anything else about the hotel diplomat , but the way his jaw was set announced that the news was n't good .	1
from somewhere inside wara 's pocket , her cell phone rang .	1
startled , she dug around and managed to pull out the small , cheap phone alejo had bought her at the hostal salta .	1
nazaret , calling to see what time i 'll be arriving , she assumed .	1
i 'm sure they 'll come to meet me .	1
`` hello ? ''	1
but it was n't wara 's friend 's voice that answered on the other end .	1
`` wara ? ''	1
the voice was male .	1
alejo ?	1
the only other person who has my number .	1
sigh .	1
`` wara !	1
where are you ? ''	1
his voice sounded urgent .	1
her heart sank .	1
was something wrong ?	1
could `` they '' be after her again ?	1
`` i 'm in the bus . ''	1
she covered the mouthpiece of the phone with her hand .	1
`` we 're about to leave . ''	1
`` wara , i , uh ? . ''	1
alejo 's voice faltered , and for a second wara thought he might cry .	1
then he said what she never expected : `` i can see .	1
god made me see again . ''	1
wara nearly dropped the phone , astonished .	1
fumbling for words , she finally managed , `` you mean your vision came back ?	1
the doctor said it might .	1
that 's ?	1
great . ''	1
`` no , no it did n't just come back .	1
wara , god did this . ''	1
alejo 's voice was racing , and his sentences all ran together .	1
`` a woman , an old quechua woman , came here an hour ago , to pray for me .	1
she said she knows you , and you told her to pray for me . ''	1
`` doa filomena ! ''	1
heat spread down the base of wara 's neck .	1
`` yes !	1
well she came to pray for me , in quechua .	1
and then i blinked , wara-just the blink of an eye .	1
i opened my eyes , and there in front of me was this wrinkled old quechua lady in a pollera , praying her heart out for me .	1
i could see it all !	1
i could see her , the hospital room with the blue curtains -- -i can see again , wara . ''	1
wara gawked at the cheap gray phone in disbelief .	1
she heard a loud bang beneath her as the baggage compartment door was slammed shut .	1
any minute now , the long bus would be pulling out of the station and wara would be headed to lima .	1
`` wow , '' she muttered , but alejo did n't even seem to hear her .	1
his voice was still shaking , and he was obviously elated .	1
`` the other day , when i woke up , i saw something , '' he said .	1
`` someone .	1
he told me that he was sending two people for us , and we should go with them . ''	1
yeah , i remember that .	1
i thought you were crazy .	1
`` he talked to me about you , too , wara . ''	1
alejo hesitated , surely knowing that his chances of convincing wara of this were very slim .	1
`` there 's something god 's going to show us .	1
please come back . ''	1
this was alejo martir talking .	1
she did n't really like him , and she did n't really trust him .	1
but he was claiming to have had a vision from god , that two people were coming to show alejo and wara something .	1
and he had a miraculous healing to back it up .	1
`` but i ca n't just ? i need to go to lima . ''	1
the excuse sounded weak in wara 's ears .	1
`` we 'll go to lima .	1
or you can go without me , wara . ''	1
alejo was insistent .	1
`` just please come back here now .	1
go tomorrow .	1
please . ''	1
wara felt a quiver as the bus began to back up , inching its way out of its narrow parking slot , curving backwards .	1
a crazy urgency filled her chest and she stood up , nearly smashing her head on the ceiling .	1
god is calling for you .	1
god is there , with alejo .	1
he gave him back his sight .	1
and he wants you to go .	1
`` i 'm coming back , '' wara said into the phone , then closed it tightly .	1
she staggered down the aisle , ignoring the curious glances of the other seated passengers .	1
there was just one thought ransacking her brain the whole time , speeding her heart into overdrive .	1
who is coming ?	1
wara exited the silver elevator on alejo 's floor at univalle , tiptoeing across the polished tiles .	1
the nurses ' station was silent and empty ; a phone rang insistently on the desk , but no one ran to answer it .	1
she inhaled raggedly and pushed open the heavy wooden door to the room she had left just a few hours before .	1
wara immediately noticed that doa filomena was gone , but two strangers clustered around the hospital bed .	1
one was a tall , lanky guy with broad shoulders and a narrow waist , buzzed sandy brown hair , and a hooked nose .	1
at the other side of the bed stood an attractive lady , older than wara , with two short black braids and fair skin .	1
they were both dressed in cheap clothes and black rubber flip flops with a healthy coating of dry mud .	1
as wara drew up next to them , the woman was pulling off the last of alejo 's bloodied bandages .	1
his hazel eyes flickered towards her as she entered , and she immediately knew he could see her .	1
that crazy grin spread across his lips as he said , `` i can see you , wara . ''	1
she gaped back at him , still not quite believing this .	1
`` you can really see .	1
did you tell dr .	1
ortega ? ''	1
`` well , i was about to , but then i got some more visitors .	1
i think it 's time for check out . ''	1
alejo 's eyes shone , and wara stared , speechless .	1
the two people who were making themselves at home in the room seemed as happy about alejo getting his sight back as he was .	1
the two just stood there , nodding and grinning as if there were nothing strange about a man getting his sight back by the power of god .	1
suddenly wara 's knees buckled .	1
there were two of them ?	1
`` there is n't much time . ''	1
the man with the wide shoulders and military haircut clapped alejo 's shoulder with slender fingers .	1
his eyes drooped slightly , but the corners of his mouth were lifted in a smile .	1
`` you must be wara . ''	1
wara nodded dumbly , still struck by the fact that there were two of them .	1
these were the messengers alejo had been told about ?	1
who were these people ?	1
`` we would like you and alejo to come with us , '' the strange man was addressing wara .	1
`` there 's someone who would like to talk with you .	1
alejo told me that both of you are believers in jesus ?	1
well then , rest easy .	1
the man who wants to see you is a believer as well , your brother .	1
but if you will come , we have to hurry .	1
there is n't much time . ''	1
the stout woman with the two braids turned towards wara , and she found herself looking into deep eyes the color of chocolate , rimmed at the edge with a touch of turquoise .	1
`` will you come with us ? ''	1
wara noted that her spanish was accented , as was the man 's .	1
something she could n't place .	1
instinctively , wara 's gaze flew to alejo .	1
it was because of him that she was standing here in the middle of this craziness .	1
he nodded at her and winked .	1
`` o-ok , '' she agreed in a daze .	1
`` i 'll go . ''	1
the two visitors grinned a little , and the woman motioned towards alejo .	1
`` quick , come see this ! ''	1
wara took a few steps forward and saw that she was pointing to the spot where alejo 's bandages had been , the wound from the bullet .	1
wara 's eyes popped to see that where alejo 's curls were shaved away there was only healthy , mocha-colored skin .	1
no trace of a scar .	1
`` is this the first time you 've seen a healing ? ''	1
the man asked , turning towards wara with that lazy half-smile .	1
she nodded mutely , and he nodded back at her kindly , as if to say , we all have to start somewhere .	1
`` alright , then .	1
time to change , '' the woman ordered , guiding wara forward with one hand on her back `` both of you , in the bathroom .	1
we paid about ten patients to keep the nurses busy , but we should hurry . ''	1
wara felt very hot , sure sweat was dripping down her backbone under her t-shirt .	1
into the bathroom ?	1
`` you , over here , '' ms. braids motioned wara towards one of the bathroom corners .	1
`` we 're going to get you into some clothes like ours , so we wo n't stand out on our little trip away from here . ''	1
glancing behind her , wara saw alejo pulling off his shirt to change in the opposite corner of the bathroom .	1
`` neither of you turn around , '' braids snickered at her .	1
`` face the wall . ''	1
wara obeyed .	1
at lightening speed , the short woman helped wara strip out of her old clothes and pull on faded sweat pants , a bulky , worn beige sweater , and black plastic sandals caked in mud .	1
with crisp efficiency , she then bundled wara 's hair on top of her head under a floppy-brimmed white hat with an attached black braid that tickled wara 's waist .	1
`` there you go , '' braids said .	1
`` no one will recognize you . ''	1
hands gripped wara 's shoulder and spun her around to face the men .	1
surreally , alejo was sporting a greasy baseball hat , ratty dress pants , and the ugliest homemade sweater wara had ever seen .	1
he did a double take , then blinked at her a couple times .	1
`` you look like mariana condori ? she used to sell us fruit in the quillacollo market when i was a little kid , '' alejo said .	1
`` i used to have a crush on her . ''	1
`` i think it 's the braid . ''	1
wara bit her lip .	1
`` you look like a nice couple of working class folk , headed home after a long day at the market , '' the tall guy said .	1
he followed them out of the bathroom , stuffing their discarded clothing into his ripped plastic market bag on the way .	1
`` time to go .	1
grab anything you need . ''	1
wara did n't need anything .	1
she jogged after the rest of them , feeling the long fake braid slapping her back .	1
she followed the three others into the hallway , which was still eerily silent .	1
with each step , her cheap plastic sandals squished noisily across the tiles .	1
at the end of the hallway , a fat metal door blocked their path , secured with two golden padlocks .	1
`` keep your face turned to ten o'clock , '' said broad shoulders .	1
wara started , then noticed the security camera in the corner facing the door .	1
patients in bolivia were n't allowed to leave the hospital until the bill was paid in full , a process that could take a full afternoon of paperwork .	1
wara drew a deep breath and followed the others in approaching the door while facing the opposite corner , away from the camera .	1
out of the corner of her eye , wara saw braids extract something from her pocket .	1
she jammed it into the lock , wiggled , and the padlock released with a soft pop .	1
the other one yielded to her touch within another thirty seconds , and broad shoulders removed the two padlocks and slung them over a bar on the door .	1
`` and now we go out , '' he said , and wara followed him outside into the cool darkness of the andean night .	1
`` ok , take the stairs on your seats , '' braids instructed , and wara sat on the cold concrete steps , eyes wide , imitating the others as they scooted down three flights of stairs hidden from the front hospital patio by the concrete wall .	1
the murmur of conversation and screech of guard whistles rose around them .	1
wara pressed her lips together , really beginning to wonder why they were scuttling down a side stairway of univalle as if this were some sort of jailbreak .	1
`` stop , '' shoulders whispered , and wara froze in place next to alejo near the bottom stair .	1
he glanced at her in the darkness , and she saw a flash of red light reflect off his irises , then bounce on the concrete wall opposite the last stair .	1
a siren beeped , then hushed , and alejo 's eyes narrowed .	1
a police car ?	1
wara began wondering if she should be worried .	1
it could n't be here for us , right ?	1
`` they wo n't recognize the four of us together . ''	1
braids turned around , crouching on the stairs .	1
`` the police car is parked just around the corner . ''	1
she eyed wara firmly .	1
`` we 're just people who came here to visit sick uncle marco after a long day of work in the market .	1
we belong here .	1
on three , we all stand up and walk towards the street .	1
slowly .	1
one , two , three . ''	1
heart drumming in her chest , wara tried to rise quietly to her feet and follow alejo and the two , trying to imagine what someone might possibly be feeling who had n't just picked two padlocks and escaped from a bolivian hospital with two complete strangers .	1
they rounded to the front of the hospital and past two olive green police vehicles , red lights periodically flashing in the night .	1
no one tried to stop them as they passed through the hospital gate and onto the dimly lit street .	1
the two strangers broke pace next to dented white toyota corolla .	1
`` climb in , '' shoulders said .	1
`` you two newbies in the back . ''	1
wara slid in next to alejo , disturbed as she suddenly remembered that less than forty-eight hours ago alejo had been sprawled on the gray blanket , bleeding , in front of this very hospital .	1
it was very weird that he was now outside , leaving , in a car with total strangers .	1
`` so , you can see now , '' she eyed him nervously .	1
`` but are you sure you 're ok to leave the hospital ? ''	1
`` i 'm absolutely wonderful , '' alejo flashed that white smile that could only remind her of pastor martir .	1
`` god healed me-did you see ?	1
it 's as if i 'd never even been shot ! ''	1
wara had seen .	1
she leaned back into the gray vinyl seat , gripping the fraying edges as shoulders leaped into the driver 's seat and whipped away around the corner , braids riding shotgun .	1
are these real people , or could they actually be angels ?	1
wara 's thoughts were running wild as she stared at both of them in the front seat .	1
and where are they taking us ?	1
30 blond they ditched the white corolla at a gas station and continued on motorcycles , the mysterious strangers , wara , and a guy who an hour ago had been blind .	1
for thirty minutes they rode out of the city , then turned off the main road to follow a rugged path cut through a cornfield .	1
the motorcycles ' headlights cut through the heavy darkness of the cornfield under the stars .	1
just when wara was afraid she would n't be able to hang on to alejo 's back any longer , the wispy tendrils of chaff fell away quickly from their background against a slate blue sky .	1
they had arrived in a clearing , and in the pale moonlight wara could see a large , two-story house , built completely out of wood .	1
sometime along the way , the tall man with the hooked nose had introduced himself as tabor , and the woman as sandal .	1
tabor parked his motorcycle next to a giant eucalyptus tree near the house and he and sandal climbed off the bike in exact synchronization .	1
alejo pulled up next to them and turned the key , leaving the four of them in the shadows of the tree , in silence .	1
wara slid off the cycle first , hiding a wince at how her legs ached after having been bowed for so long .	1
alejo was still wearing that half-loony grin , ecstatic at being able to see again and having his vision come true .	1
he sobered a little at the sight of her pinched face , as if just now realizing she might possibly be scared half to death .	1
`` you 're brave , '' he said to her , startling her into a slight smile .	1
he waited for her , and the two of them walked side by side after sandal and tabor towards the looming house .	1
the rough , unvarnished door was made of a blond wood and had been left cracked open , as if expecting visitors .	1
wara shivered , staring at the house and the wood door .	1
`` come on .	1
i 'm sure he 's really anxious to meet you , '' sandal said , waiting for wara to walk past her through the door .	1
she met wara 's eyes with the hint of an encouraging smile .	1
the spacious room inside the house was a stark contrast to the blurry darkness outside .	1
this room was filled with light , blazing from a small chandelier formed from deer antlers .	1
in the far corner , several brown leather couches clustered under woven tapestries with the familiar designs of quechua children and snow-peaked mountains .	1
with a start , wara realized that there was a fifth person in the room , nearly camouflaged against a plain wooden wall to her left .	1
he was wearing brown slacks and a tan button-down shirt , with wool slippers .	1
he looked about sixty , a little paunchy , with balding brown hair and a bushy mustache .	1
ice blue eyes observed alejo keenly , then drifted over to wara .	1
`` welcome to my home . ''	1
the man 's voice was deep and calm .	1
there was no accent to the man 's spanish , despite his very un-bolivian appearance .	1
`` i am really very glad you came . ''	1
alejo remained standing close to wara , on a coral-colored rug in the center of the room .	1
`` hello , '' he said , hands loose at his side .	1
both men watched each other for a moment , sizing each other up .	1
then alejo asked , `` who are you ? ''	1
`` a very good question . ''	1
the older man 's cool blue eyes crinkled around the edges .	1
`` my name is rupert cole , and this is my home .	1
you have arrived at an ostrich farm . ''	1
mr. cole seemed to expect the surprised looks on their faces , and he chuckled .	1
`` if you decide to stay awhile , in the morning i could give you a tour .	1
but for now , my job is to make sure you are n't spooked and run away .	1
you already met sandal and tabor . ''	1
mr. cole looked over towards the door , but the two who had come to the hospital were already gone .	1
`` oh , they 'll be back , '' mr. cole assured wara in a tone that told her he had read her mind as she wondered if they had been angels and disappeared into thin air .	1
`` i 'm sure they just went to change out of those clothes .	1
i do n't have your names , '' mr. cole told them quietly .	1
`` i 'm alejo . ''	1
alejo held out his hand as mr. cole reached forward to shake it firmly .	1
`` it 's a pleasure to meet you , mr .	1
cole . ''	1
`` please call me rupert . ''	1
rupert 's eyes crinkled slightly again .	1
`` my father was mr .	1
cole . ''	1
rupert 's gaze fell on wara , and she slowly pulled the hat and fake braid off her head , leaving her own hair falling in disarray around her shoulders .	1
`` i 'm wara cadogan , '' she told him smally , shaking one thick , rough hand with her own .	1
rupert motioned them towards the brown leather couches .	1
`` please do n't run away just yet .	1
the reason you 're here is because i have a job offer for you , which i 'll tell you about when you 're ready .	1
but for now , i really want to help you , however i can .	1
i know things are a little up in the air right now , to say the least .	1
i work for an organization that can help . ''	1
wara followed alejo in taking a seat on the couch , across from rupert cole .	1
alejo regarded the older man calmly , face giving nothing away .	1
`` how do you know about us ? ''	1
he asked .	1
rupert 's cool blue eyes flashed .	1
`` i had a dream about you , alejo .	1
now before you laugh , it 's not like this happens all the time .	1
this is only the third time god showed me something in a dream . ''	1
another dream ?	1
wara crossed her arms and leaned back into the cool leather of the couch , feeling a little out of her element .	1
alejo did not appear at all fazed .	1
after all , he had known they would be coming here .	1
with tabor and sandal .	1
rupert was continuing .	1
`` so , what i saw was a man with a gun against his forehead .	1
the gun fired .	1
i assume that was you ? ''	1
alejo nodded a little uncomfortably , probably remembering the scene at pairumani .	1
`` and yet here you are , '' rupert waved one burly forearm , `` at my house , safe and sound .	1
i saw you being carried into the hospital , and a girl with dark hair and a star over her head was standing near the door , crying .	1
i saw the sign on the hospital : univalle .	1
it was as clear as day .	1
i was about to follow you inside , alejo , when a man grabbed my arm and said , 'they will look for him because of what happened to the bus . '	1
now in my dream , i understood exactly what he was talking about : the death road bus accident .	1
which may not have been an accident .	1
am i right ? ''	1
rupert 's calm gaze searched alejo 's face , which had grown very serious .	1
`` it was n't an accident , '' alejo admitted in a low voice .	1
`` how did you know ? ''	1
`` my brother robert cole works at the embassy , and took a call from a man who talked about that bus , and told him the american girl was still alive and with him .	1
in my dream i saw her with a star .	1
and here you are . ''	1
rupert nodded at wara .	1
`` wara .	1
aymara for star . ''	1
`` listen , '' he sighed and continued lowly , `` the truth is , the both of you are in a heap of trouble , and i believe i 'm supposed to help you .	1
from the little i know , you , '' he jerked a thumb in alejo 's direction , `` are in a lot of trouble .	1
you 've broken bolivian law and , i assume , have people from your organization after you .	1
and you , '' rupert looked at wara steadily but kindly , `` are in trouble because you know things you should n't know and have seen things that no civilian who was just riding a bus should have to see .	1
neither of you can just go back into your old lives , just show up in society as you were .	1
i think you both understand that . ''	1
wara felt hot tears prick her eyes .	1
rupert heaved a sigh and then said , `` there 's a reason i sent tabor and sandal to get you out of that hospital so quickly after my dream .	1
i was relieved to see your faces here in my living room , because i wondered if i would get to you in time .	1
come with me , both of you ; there 's something i have to show you . ''	1
alejo and wara wordlessly padded after rupert cole across the hardwood floor and through a darkened doorway .	1
the older man flipped on a light , revealing an office with blond wood walls and multiple low bookcases painted a very ugly burnt orange .	1
a tiny black computer desk sat under a picture window that really needed washing .	1
rupert plopped down on a chair in front of the extra-wide flat screen .	1
`` have a seat there , '' he told them quietly , motioning to two comfortable-looking plaid swivel chairs a few paces behind him .	1
they obeyed , and wara watched as rupert pressed his thumb against the blank computer screen and said a few numbers out loud .	1
immediately , the computer whirled and came to life , showing a background with a gray generic windows drawing and two small rows of icons .	1
sandal and tabor were back , having changed out of the tattered clothes from the hospital .	1
they waited in silence at the back of the office , arms crossed in front of their chests .	1
`` i apologize in advance , in case this is upsetting . ''	1
wara assumed rupert was talking to her .	1
`` i know about this video from my brother who works at the american embassy , robert .	1
it was posted on youtube , but of course has already been taken down .	1
but the embassy has a copy , i have a copy ? who knows who else has this . ''	1
rupert scooted his chair to one side , glanced back at alejo with very serious eyes , and then the pixels of color on the wide computer screen came together in the image of a young guy with a reddish goatee wearing black against a background of a large black , white , and green stripe with a red triangle .	1
the flag of palestine , was the first thing wara thought as she frowned at the large flag .	1
then her blood ran cold as it registered that the lanky , blond guy standing there was wearing a long-sleeve black shirt underneath a layer of explosives and wires encasing his chest .	1
a suicide bomber .	1
the young man stood in front of the flag in a black woolen sailor 's cap , wearing the explosive vest in a very matter-of-fact fashion .	1
instead of brandishing a long machine gun , as was the typical image wara had seen of suicide bombers , he was gripping a violin over one shoulder , standing still for the camera .	1
wara started when she heard alejo fly out of his chair , biting back a loud curse .	1
his face was contorted , and he kicked at the swivel chair with one violent motion , clenching his fist .	1
`` gabriel , you idiot !	1
do n't do this to me ! ''	1
heart spiraling down to her toes , wara turned back to the man on the screen and realized that it was the same pale gabriel who had left her at the hospital .	1
she gripped the armrests of her chair tighter .	1
gabriel was repeating a prayer or verse from the quran in arabic .	1
when he finished , he looked into the camera almost curiously and said , `` first i would like to send a message to my parents .	1
dad , you were wonderful , and i thank you for your example .	1
you were always a faithful believer .	1
mom , i pray that allah will grant you the grace to continue to be a faithful believer despite all the trials .	1
please do n't be angry at me for this .	1
you know that allah will reward me with paradise , and i will be there , waiting for both of you .	1
mom , i will especially be waiting for your good cooking . ''	1
at this point , gabriel 's lips twisted into a wry smile , and his green eyes searched the camera .	1
`` i do this as my jihad against the cause of injustice , against those who maim and kill god 's people in palestine and around the world . ''	1
gabriel looked at his violin a moment , reflectively , and then continued , `` i am not a tough warrior or a soldier .	1
but with this my weapon , my talent that allah has given me , i fight for his cause in the world and thus win his favor for paradise . ''	1
gabriel quoted a verse from the quran , in spanish : `` allah has bought from the believers their lives and their money in exchange for paradise .	1
thus , they fight in the cause of allah , willing to kill and get killed .	1
such is his truthful pledge in the torah , the gospel , and the quran - and who fulfills his pledge better than allah ?	1
you shall rejoice in making such an exchange .	1
this is the greatest triumph . ''	1
`` no , no , no ! ''	1
alejo was back in his chair , leaning forward , pleading .	1
he slammed one fist into his knee .	1
`` gabo , do n't do this ! ''	1
but of course everyone realized that he already had .	1
`` i have always been a faithful muslim , '' gabriel 's eyes bored into theirs from the screen , `` except for a few indiscretions where i allowed my heart to get ahead of my faithful service to allah .	1
for that , i offer my life now in jihad , against the injustices of the world and against the unrighteousness in my own heart .	1
i pray allah will purify me by fire and accept me into paradise . ''	1
wara struggled to inflate her frozen lungs .	1
had gabriel thought he disobeyed god by letting her and alejo go ?	1
`` i know that certain people will be very ticked off that i did this . ''	1
gabriel 's mouth twisted wryly again , and he lowered the violin to his side .	1
`` but please know that i really cared about you all , all of my friends , and am thankful to have enjoyed so many good memories together .	1
i 'll miss the brownies , the trips , all our conversations over coffee .	1
but then again , i may not miss them at all .	1
i think that in paradise all those things will fade into memory , because i 'm sure that life there is pretty good . ''	1
gabriel lowered his lashes , then looked up and started to walk towards the camera .	1
`` this was a very strange video of this type , i know .	1
i have always been a very quirky guy .	1
i 'll be waiting for all you guys , so please do n't disappoint me , ok ? ''	1
he disappeared to the side of the screen , leaving for one moment the view of the huge palestinian flag , hanging in silence .	1
then the video was cut , and the only thing visible was an advertisement from youtube .	1
alejo was bowed over onto his knees , sobbing .	1
wara was stunned to see stern alejo sitting there , crying like a baby .	1
rupert obviously had expected his .	1
`` i thought that you might know him , '' he said in a gravelly voice .	1
`` of course , this is what happened to the hotel diplomat this afternoon .	1
i also have a video taken from a camera phone found in the rubble , of the actual detonation , which you will not be allowed to see . ''	1
wara sucked in a deep breath , fighting nausea .	1
`` the embassy was n't really investigating anything after the phone call you made , not yet .	1
but with these videos , the investigation starts for real .	1
the u.s. , bolivia , and israel will be combing every corner to find out who the man in the video is , and who is connected to him . ''	1
it could have been wara 's imagination , but rupert 's blue eyes seemed a little misty and his face wore the look of a man who had lost many comrades in his day .	1
`` i -- -i think i need to go to lay down , '' wara stammered , standing up shakily and facing sandal .	1
`` can ? is there a room here where i can sleep ? ''	1
`` of course , '' sandal understood perfectly .	1
`` i 'll take you to your room .	1
we will all be here tomorrow . ''	1
feeling faint , wara left the office and the sound of alejo 's tears .	1
31 plaid alejo woke the next morning with a cool breeze rustling the gauze curtains and caressing his face .	1
he was lying on his stomach on a single bed with thick wool blankets in a room with walls that smelled of cedar .	1
his limbs felt like lead and his heart torn to pieces , but he forced himself to sit up on the edge of the bed and breathe .	1
the man wara loved was dead , thanks to alejo gabriel had blown himself to pieces in jihad , trying to make allah love him .	1
alejo still remembered the scoffing tone of his friend 's voice in the delivery truck when alejo told him his decision about jesus : `` the quran tells us everything we need to please god .	1
and i 've been doing it all .	1
we are the best of the best , che .	1
why would we need some person to take away our sins ?	1
we are serving allah every day .	1
we 're not unbelievers who do n't follow his laws .	1
he 's got to accept me . ''	1
what better way to earn allah 's favor than as a suicide bomber , making the ultimate sacrifice to do allah 's will ?	1
except man ca n't earn god 's favor .	1
alejo resisted the urge to sink back down onto the bed , depressed .	1
only the savior of the world can atone for the sins of men .	1
everyone is dead , alejo thought .	1
my life is a mess .	1
god , i ca n't think about anything but wara 's tortured eyes as she misses noah , or gabriel , shouting allah akbar and pulling the detonation cord .	1
alejo groaned and leaned forward onto his knees .	1
last night , after alejo had composed himself , rupert told him that , from the camera phone video , it was clear that gabriel had entered the restaurant in a tuxedo , apparently hired to play the violin in the restaurant of the hotel diplomat during lunch .	1
he had simply walked over to the table of the two israeli diplomats while playing a violin piece and detonated the explosives .	1
the early estimates were in favor of a death toll of over seventy .	1
i have to do something , or i 'm going to go crazy in here .	1
alejo stood up suddenly .	1
tabor was about his size and had left him a mound of clean clothes on top of a cedar chest in the corner .	1
alejo got dressed and padded out of his room on bare feet , towards the bathroom on the first floor where he and wara had been given rooms .	1
leaving the bathroom , alejo could hear the soft clink of silverware coming from the kitchen , around the corner from the end of the hall .	1
he found rupert cole , along with tabor and sandal , breakfasting on pancakes and coffee .	1
rupert was lounging in a worn , khaki bathrobe with the same woolly slippers on his feet .	1
sandal was wearing a tight red sweat suit that no one over twenty-five should be caught dead in , covered in jewels and large silver letters .	1
her jet black hair was tied back in a messy ponytail , dark circles under her eyes .	1
she slowly nursed a chipped mug of black coffee , eyes flitting to alejo with a bare acknowledgement of his entrance .	1
alejo immediately pegged her as not a morning person .	1
tabor wore running gear and seemed chipper and alert .	1
he nodded at alejo and gulped the last of something that looked like a protein energy shake .	1
`` ru really wants you to stay , '' tabor said , languid eyes twinkling .	1
`` he made you pancakes .	1
the guy is a great cook . ''	1
alejo slid into a chair across the table from tabor , where an empty place setting seemed to be waiting .	1
he assumed that tabor and sandal must be some kind of agents in the organization rupert worked with , the `` job offer '' he had mentioned last night .	1
if he had to guess , he would say sandal was from iran or iraq , and tabor from israel .	1
rupert ducked into the kitchen and reappeared with a glass carafe of french press coffee , which he emptied into alejo 's mug .	1
`` good morning .	1
i assume you like strong coffee , '' he said in an even tone , then placed a platter covered with tinfoil in front of alejo .	1
`` the ones with nuts are banana mango .	1
then there are the german chocolate ones , too .	1
honey and butter are right there . ''	1
`` wow .	1
thanks . ''	1
alejo looked up at him and offered a tight smile .	1
he was actually glad that rupert was holding off on the job offer until after breakfast , because alejo felt like dirt .	1
`` i 'm impressed .	1
is wara up yet ? ''	1
`` no , she 's still sleeping , '' sandal croaked , looking up groggily from her coffee , `` which i would still be if certain people had n't insisted i go running with them . ''	1
tabor scoffed .	1
`` i do n't know why you did n't just stay in bed .	1
you only ran like a hundred meters with me , anyway . ''	1
`` you know i do n't do mornings . ''	1
sandal glared at him , then forked a bite of pancake rather violently .	1
she speared alejo with her bleary gaze , about to speak when rupert dumped two pancakes on alejo 's plate and clapped him on the shoulder .	1
`` you need to eat , '' he said calmly , but the tone left no doubt it was an order .	1
alejo reluctantly forced himself to eat and gulp down coffee .	1
when he had emptied his plate , rupert scraped his chair back and said , `` come walk outside with me . ''	1
glancing towards the hall and still seeing no sign of wara , alejo nodded curtly .	1
`` let me get some shoes . ''	1
`` i suppose i should change out of my bathrobe , '' rupert sighed , glancing down at his plaid pajama pants , fuzzy robe , and slippers .	1
he shuffled up the winding wood staircase , where alejo assumed her slept .	1
by the time alejo had retrieved his sandals and washed up a little , rupert was waiting outside the door on a narrow stone path that cut through the grass of his lawn .	1
beyond the lawn , a dusty area began where rings of tall barbed wire fences circled ostrich pens .	1
`` this is where you live ? ''	1
alejo shoved hands in his pockets as the two of them fell in step on a slow walk around the lawn .	1
`` this is my home , yes , '' rupert said thoughtfully .	1
`` i 'm gone of course , often , for my work . ''	1
`` your brother works at the embassy .	1
and you live here , in the bolivian countryside , and have an ostrich farm .	1
why would a gringo want to live all the way out here ? ''	1
rupert scoffed and raised one eyebrow .	1
`` do n't let my pale face fool you .	1
my parents were american , but i never applied for my american citizenship after the age of eighteen . ''	1
`` where did you grow up then ? ''	1
rupert grinned and raised one fuzzy eyebrow at alejo .	1
`` would you be at all shocked if i told you my parents were missionaries in morocco ?	1
the man you are looking at is one hundred percent moroccan , heart and soul . ''	1
alejo looked over at him and whistled .	1
`` wow .	1
a missionary kid .	1
morocco .	1
it 's a very nice country .	1
so , would you be at all shocked if i told you i 'm a pastor 's son ? ''	1
rupert 's calm eyes did , indeed , widen .	1
he recovered quickly and cleared his throat .	1
`` uh , yes , actually , i would ! ''	1
a grin spread across his face .	1
`` we make a fine pair , hmm ? ''	1
`` yeah , well you at least have been following the path of your parents .	1
the example my parents gave me when i was young was not one i wanted to follow . ''	1
there was a long pause , and then rupert said , `` i have n't always been on the straight and narrow path , walking in the light .	1
i 'm sure you would n't be shocked if i told you i used to be cia .	1
i worked at the top levels for ten years , with the cia for a total of twenty-five years .	1
i was mean , ornery , and i would do anything to get the job done .	1
by the time i was fifty i was on my third wife . ''	1
alejo pressed his lips together , staring straight ahead .	1
`` ten years ago , the lord found me and called me into his kingdom -- -just like that , from right in the middle of the places of power of the kingdom of this world .	1
i became his disciple-and everything changed .	1
i had a new boss , and i could no longer do whatever the powers-that-be above me ordered me to do , when it was against the orders of jesus .	1
you know what i mean ? ''	1
alejo nodded , seriously .	1
`` well , alejo , i realized i could n't continue in the cia and follow jesus .	1
when i emptied out my retirement account to give to the poor , my third wife , ellie , left me .	1
so now , here i am , alone and with all the time in the world to do what the lord brings my way .	1
for now , it is this organization . ''	1
rupert 's voice drawled lazily , but his tone was intense .	1
they had reached the far corner of the property now , and rupert led them into a small grape arbor .	1
he lowered himself with a grunt onto the grass under the tangled mass of vines , and alejo followed him , sitting cross-legged on the cool ground .	1
he now knew about rupert 's past : missionary kid from morocco , cia , three failed marriages .	1
what he did n't know was what was going on now , in the present .	1
what am i doing here ?	1
`` i guess you brought me here for the recruitment speech , '' he said , measuring rupert with his eyes .	1
rupert smiled lazily .	1
`` i guess i did .	1
like i said , i want to help you .	1
but the fact you were recommended to me in a dream makes me think god brought you here for the recruitment speech . ''	1
alejo scrunched up his face , surprised by the thought .	1
`` we 're called ci , '' rupert told him .	1
`` short for cole , inc , the shipping company here in morocco my grandfather owned and gave to me .	1
we 've transformed the company into something a little different .	1
the agents who work with us are called lukes .	1
there 's a verse in the bible we believe in , and it says , 'the spirit of the lord is upon me , because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor , to bring liberty to the captives . '	1
we believe in that , bringing god 's kingdom to earth . ''	1
so rupert wants me to work with him and become a luke .	1
`` most of us in ci may not have come by our special skills in the best of ways , '' rupert continued explaining .	1
`` but now that we belong to jesus we want to use our talents to obey him , not give power and riches to the kingdoms of this world .	1
we work to save those who are in prison or in danger for their belief in jesus or their defense of human rights . ''	1
alejo 's temple throbbed and he felt himself grimacing .	1
of course , this was what he wanted to do .	1
when he worked with the prism , had n't it been to bring justice to the world , to help those in need ?	1
he could do this , work with rupert in ci .	1
but now ?	1
now alejo barely even knew who he was .	1
so much had changed .	1
`` i 'm ? really messed up , rupert .	1
what you 're saying is all i want to do .	1
but i need help . ''	1
`` i know , '' rupert said simply .	1
`` these are hard times .	1
what would you say if we prayed , right now ? ''	1
alejo blinked .	1
`` ok. '' when rupert had finished praying , alejo felt too weak to get up just yet .	1
`` i just need some time ? ''	1
he started to say hoarsely , but rupert was already heading out of the vineyard .	1
`` take a half-hour , '' he said , eyes sparkling .	1
`` then i 'll be back .	1
we have plenty of time to discuss details about ci later .	1
there is one thing we have to talk about now , though .	1
it 's going to be good , son . ''	1
alejo could n't be sure , but he could have sworn that , just before rupert turned to go , he had winked .	1
the half hour alone under the grape leaves was intense , and alejo prayed and thought , trying to get his bearings .	1
he felt so relieved , being forgiven by jesus .	1
but there were so many things that were still messed up , other people he had hurt .	1
right now , i 'm thinking mainly of wara and my family .	1
an image of noah hearst 's very pale , grieving parents flashed through his mind and he sighed .	1
there did n't seem to be much he could ever do to make it right with them .	1
alejo closed his eyes , listening to the sound of songbirds in the fruit trees outside the grape arbor .	1
fallen grapes fermenting in the sun gave off the essence of sweet red wine .	1
rays of sunlight filtered through the leaves and warmed his face .	1
i can see .	1
it amazed him again , and he remembered the despair he had felt in univalle , when he woke up and realized everything was black .	1
alejo thought about the cool steel of the khan 's gun against his temple , the hurt of betrayed love in the pashto man 's red eyes as he stared alejo down .	1
he could n't remember the actual shot , but he was sure it should have been lethal .	1
god had let him live , and brought him here , to this place , to another follower of jesus who seemed to understand everything he was going through .	1
a dry crunching sounded outside the canopy of grape leaves ; the hanging greenery parted , and rupert ducked inside , downing something from an ancient olive-green thermos with golden paisleys .	1
another red plaid thermos was in his other hand , which he held out towards alejo .	1
`` coffee , '' he said briefly , taking another swig .	1
`` you might as well know , i 'm an addict . ''	1
`` thanks . ''	1
alejo unscrewed the lid of the thermos and took a drink of the bitter liquid .	1
rupert really did make strong coffee .	1
another perk of working with him -- -along with the fact that he had dreams of the future and seemed to hear directly from god .	1
rupert downed more coffee , then stiffly sat down in the grass at a comfortable distance from alejo .	1
`` ah , what are we doing here hiding out under the leaves and sitting in the muck like kindergartners ? ''	1
alejo grinned .	1
`` i have a slew of chairs over on the porch .	1
but it is kind of nice in here , is n't it ?	1
all shady ? ''	1
rupert settled in a little , then faced alejo squarely .	1
`` the time is coming to ask all your questions , but i want you to work with me .	1
if you accept , i would like to propose a time of discipleship here , at the farm .	1
what that means is learning to follow jesus , to be a disciple .	1
we would spend three months together , along with the other guys who come in and out of here , and i 'd teach you everything i 've learned over the years .	1
do you think i would drive you batty ? ''	1
`` maybe . ''	1
alejo paused .	1
`` but i need it .	1
i 'm kind of starting from scratch .	1
even if you find out later i do n't meet your requirements to work in ci , i think i really need to stay here .	1
since you 're offering . ''	1
he felt his mouth tip into a lopsided smile .	1
rupert seemed pleased .	1
`` i 'm offering .	1
after the three months , you would go on an exploratory trip with some of my lukes , to open your eyes a little to what we do and help you decide if you want to join .	1
i want you to know , too , that we can help your family .	1
i 'll tell you about that later , some very nice options of places they can settle .	1
i would love to meet them .	1
but , about wara ? ''	1
`` i really messed her life up , too , '' alejo muttered .	1
his relief was intense at the idea of someone helping him resettle his family and wara somewhere safe .	1
`` can you get a new id and passport for her , too ?	1
we could ask her where she 'd like to live , maybe close to my family ? ''	1
`` you saved her life . ''	1
rupert held up his hand to stop alejo .	1
`` and , sending her to live with your family is n't what i wanted to talk to you about .	1
last night in my office , you mentioned her a lot .	1
you talked about how she has great linguistic skills , makes even-keeled decisions under pressure , and has good tactical decisions -- -for a civilian , you understand .	1
so , son , i was thinking that wara should also stay here with us .	1
we need more female lukes , and with her coloring she would be able to pass as native in many places that a lot of the other women ca n't .	1
wara could work with us , '' rupert repeated , `` and you can help train her . ''	1
alejo felt his jaw drop .	1
`` umm , i do n't ? i do n't ? sir . ''	1
he paused , trying to think of something rational to say .	1
`` she does n't know anything about ? all this kind of life . ''	1
`` neither did you , when you started , '' rupert shrugged , taking a large swallow of coffee .	1
`` she can learn .	1
listen , son .	1
when we prayed today , we talked about god 's forgiveness .	1
what i wanted to talk with you about now is the issue of forgiveness from others who you have offended .	1
wara is a woman who has been hurt .	1
because of you .	1
unintentionally , but i still believe that god would have you make it right . ''	1
this was a totally unexpected turn of events .	1
he had envisioned his new connection with rupert helping his family and wara to a safe location , to happily start their lives over .	1
not wara in close proximity to him , who she did n't care for at all .	1
besides , being close to him was dangerous .	1
`` alejo , i have a sort of penance for you , '' rupert continued explaining to a dumbfounded alejo .	1
`` not to be forgiven by god , but to make things right and restore what you have destroyed .	1
because of what happened , wara 's safety , work , and the man she loved were taken away .	1
if wara joins ci , you can protect her and watch out for her .	1
you can help her use her talents for the kingdom , by sharing what you know so she can work with us .	1
and you can try to give back what you took away : the man that she loved . ''	1
now alejo truly gaped .	1
what ?	1
`` i 'm sorry .	1
i do n't know what you 're talking about . ''	1
`` i 'm assigning you to love wara , and be the man that she loves in return .	1
i want you to take noah 's place . ''	1
alejo cringed .	1
he swallowed against a throat that was dry like sandpaper , then sputtered .	1
`` uh , that is a very bad idea .	1
wara ca n't stand the sight of me .	1
i 'm the man who blew up her bus and killed noah . ''	1
alejo felt sure that rupert would see the craziness of what he had just suggested .	1
`` yes , you did tell me about that , '' rupert remarked calmly , seemingly unfazed .	1
`` this is what i propose .	1
it 's pretty simple .	1
i think we should explain all this to wara-about ci , the exploratory trip , and see if she accepts .	1
if she feels called to join and agrees to go on the trip , then it 'll be all settled .	1
you will do what i say , train her , and be the man she loves . ''	1
alejo had to really work to compose himself enough to speak .	1
`` sir , i would like her to work with you , because i think she would be good at it , and i know she can learn .	1
i 'd feel a lot better knowing i could keep an eye on her .	1
but i 'm 100 % sure she would never accept , not if she knows i 'm here .	1
and would be her trainer ! ''	1
alejo could just see the look on her face now : repulsion at the idea .	1
`` it 's never going to happen , '' he repeated .	1
why could rupert not see this ?	1
`` she might accept being a luke , but she would never love ? .me . ''	1
rupert waved one hairy hand at him .	1
`` it 's really not that complicated , alejo , '' he continued slowly , as if explaining something to a small , particularly dull child .	1
`` who was noah to wara ?	1
he was a man who loved the lord .	1
he was her best friend .	1
he loved her unconditionally .	1
you can do all this . ''	1
alejo 's mouth opened , then snapped shut .	1
he unscrewed the lid to his thermos with a vengeance and took a long gulp of hot , strong coffee .	1
`` besides , '' rupert was pressing on , `` i 've spent quite a few years in my day around guys like you .	1
i can read you pretty well , even if no one else can .	1
i know you 're interested .	1
in her . ''	1
coffee spewed from alejo 's lips onto his muddy knees as he nearly choked .	1
`` i think you 're already a little attracted to her .	1
c'mon , i 'm not asking you to crawl on your hands and knees from here to the vatican with a belt of nails around your waist , or live for a year on locusts and honey .	1
just a little penance , a little making things right .	1
you 'll be fine . ''	1
rupert heaved himself up from the ground with a loud crack , clumps of dirt clinging to his worn jeans .	1
alejo was still stunned , and he wiped coffee from his chin with one sleeve , watching rupert warily .	1
`` we should tell her tonight , at the latest , '' rupert said , walking towards the edge of the arbor .	1
apparently noticing alejo draw back like a deer in the headlights , rupert turned around and crossed his arms , annoyed .	1
`` i did n't mean we should tell her tonight that you 're proposing marriage !	1
jeepers !	1
for that , i 'm giving you some time .	1
all i meant was that we should talk with her about ci and see what she says . ''	1
alejo got up from the muddy grass , rather shakily .	1
`` you said that wara was in the dream you had , did n't you ? ''	1
he asked , feeling a headache coming on .	1
`` she was . ''	1
rupert seemed much too delighted .	1
`` god sent her to me , too , and i think we are just beginning to discover the reason . ''	1
with another wink , rupert disappeared into the yard , leaving alejo alone , standing in the arbor .	1
with a deep groan , alejo shoved his hands in his pockets and began walking towards the house .	1
32 white on wara 's fifth day at the ostrich farm , she allowed herself to admit that rupert 's pancakes really were delicious .	1
that morning , he had cooked up one pile with fresh raspberries and cream , and the other with bittersweet chocolate and dulce de leche .	1
the day before it had been orange butterscotch and strawberries with a wine sauce .	1
wara still could n't remember what she had had for breakfast the first morning she had come here ; it was all still a blur .	1
the night had been filled with violent dreams about noah and gabriel , and wara had woken up late , without the strength to talk to anyone .	1
on day number two , at night , rupert had sat down , with a very silent alejo , and presented the crazy plan in which she , a flabby linguist from montana , would become part of the organization rupert worked with , called ci .	1
she truly could n't imagine she would be any use ; she did n't know anything about all this spy-style business .	1
but it seemed obvious that god wanted her here , and honestly , she did n't have the strength at the moment to spend hours analyzing why .	1
day number four was the day she had sat in rupert 's office and told him she would go on a trip to learn more about ci .	1
when she informed rupert that the answer was yes , she had been sitting in one of the plaid swivel chairs in rupert 's office , trying not to look at the blank computer screen where she had seen gabriel 's suicide video .	1
rupert stood behind alejo 's swivel chair , and his teeth flashed in a grin under his bushy mustache as he punched alejo in the shoulder .	1
`` so it begins ! ''	1
he crowed , obviously quite pleased .	1
`` there you go , che . ''	1
alejo smiled weakly at rupert 's words .	1
rupert walked over to wara and clasped her hand , shaking it warmly .	1
`` i swear i will take care of you like my own daughter .	1
of course , you can still change your mind after your exploratory trip , but if you 're who i see when i look at you , i know you wo n't . ''	1
now it was wara 's seventh day at rupert 's little ostrich farm , and tomorrow she would be leaving to fly to lima .	1
she would spend a few days with the martirs , then fly home to bozeman to spend three months with her family .	1
alejo would go to see his family after wara left them , and help them get settled in a new location that he and rupert had worked out .	1
then alejo would come back here to the ostrich farm to stay for the time until their exploratory trip .	1
i need time to heal , wara thought as she leaned back into one of rupert 's chocolate leather sofas and stretched her bare feet out on the coffee table .	1
her laptop was open next to her on the couch and she was alone in the living room , listening to the sound of noah 's voice .	1
until a few days ago , she had n't remembered that her laptop contained two albums of music noah and eduardo sejas had recorded in cochabamba at a studio .	1
maybe it was n't professional quality , but to wara noah 's voice was beautiful .	1
a door scraped across the wood of rupert 's living room and she saw the older man and alejo standing in the office .	1
`` wara , dear , could you come in here for a minute ? ''	1
rupert was grinning , as if he and alejo were in the middle of a joke .	1
alejo , however , had the pained grimace of a man who had just escaped the dentist after a root canal .	1
what plots had they been hatching in rupert 's office ?	1
wara reluctantly muted noah mid-song and slid her bare feet to the floor .	1
she headed towards the office , where rupert motioned towards a swivel chair .	1
`` we 've already covered a few things for your upcoming trip , '' he addressed both of them .	1
`` and the rest we 'll talk about later , after you 've had more time .	1
wara 's flight 's leaving tomorrow , though , so it 's about time to put the finishing touches on her passport .	1
of course i have to make your docs with different names , since you 're both supposed to be dead .	1
now , '' rupert fought off a yawn and leaned into the swivel chair with a heavy squeak , `` i 've got you down as paulo . ''	1
he fixed his eyes on alejo , who grimly nodded .	1
`` paul , the man who , like you , was healed from blindness by god .	1
now what about you , wara cadogan ?	1
are you ready to change names ? ''	1
she had known rupert was going to ask her this ; he had warned her at breakfast this morning .	1
after pancakes , she had taken a walk and thought : if alejo is paul , then i am peter .	1
once again she had seen noah beside her on the bus , holding her hand with eyes full of grace and saying those words : you 're back .	1
at the seaside , after jesus rose again , he brought peter back .	1
peter swore with a curse he did n't know jesus and jesus forgave him .	1
jesus brought him back .	1
unfortunately , peter was not a good name for women .	1
thankfully , wara knew quite a few languages .	1
`` i 'm thinking about ? petra , '' she said carefully , trying out the sound of the name on her lips .	1
`` you know , greek for 'rock ' . ''	1
rupert 's eyes glowed .	1
`` it 's good , '' he said simply .	1
`` i love it . ''	1
the living room was dim as they left rupert 's office , closing the door on him as he powered up his spy computer to make some skype calls .	1
a single , white porcelain lamp with a scuffed shade was shining from the corner next to the sofas .	1
tabor and sandal were nowhere in sight .	1
preferring to say goodnight here rather than in the pitch black hallway on the way to their rooms , wara turned towards alejo , the words on her tongue .	1
but alejo was gone .	1
then she noticed him crouching on the floor in front of her , head bowed towards the floor .	1
he was crying .	1
`` wara , '' he said gruffly , `` i 'm so sorry . ''	1
he did n't remove his gaze from the floor and his hands shook .	1
`` i can never pay you for what i did to you .	1
please , forgive me . ''	1
wara took an unsteady step back and swallowed hard .	1
alejo was asking her to forgive him .	1
i 'm petra now .	1
i 'm here because he forgave my huge debt .	1
and now it 's time for me to follow in his footsteps .	1
the words formed very slowly in her brain .	1
`` alejo , it 's ok , '' she said , then slid down to the warm wood floor in front of him .	1
`` it 's all taken care of . ''	1
starting visibly , alejo lifted his head and peered at her with reddened hazel eyes .	1
`` but i ca n't ? ''	1
`` i know .	1
i accept that you ca n't pay .	1
i forgive you . ''	1
he let his head roll back towards the ceiling , then faced her again .	1
`` thank you . ''	1
he lowered himself down to sit cross-legged as she was , not even bothering to swipe away the raw tears matting his eyelashes .	1
`` thank you . ''	1
she struggled to know what else to say to him .	1
it was one thing to forgive him .	1
trusting him was quite another .	1
but what good is forgiveness if it 's only words ?	1
one day at a time .	1
and it had to start somewhere .	1
there was something she still had n't said to him , and it was important .	1
`` thank you , '' she told him honestly , searching his face .	1
`` you saved my life .	1
you gave up a lot to save me .	1
thank you . ''	1
alejo blinked , then his face found a hint of the famous martir grin he shared with his father .	1
they sat there staring at each other for a few minutes , letting the moment sink in .	1
then alejo broke the silence , voice thick with relief .	1
`` so , we 'll meet in three months , then .	1
you 're going to see your parents ? ''	1
wara paused to consider , then decided to blaze forward .	1
`` yeah .	1
maybe you can call sometime , just , you know , to make sure that none of the bad guys have hauled me away . ''	1
she pressed her lips together and tried to match alejo 's small smile .	1
`` you are going to be pretty hard to get a hold of out here on the farm with rupert . ''	1
alejo blinked fast , obviously pleased with her idea .	1
`` should i give you the phone number to my parents ' house ? ''	1
she asked .	1
now alejo 's mouth flickered into a full-blown smile .	1
`` naw .	1
do n't worry , wara . ''	1
the warm white light of the lamp glinted off his eyes as the two of them sat facing each other , she with a spark of curiosity , he with eyes making a solemn promise .	1
`` i 'll find you . ''	1
33 grape after the ostriches had been fed and all the fences repaired and in working order , alejo carried a wooden porch chair into the luxuriant grape arbor .	1
he plopped down in the chair , slinging his feet up on an overturned five gallon bucket he left inside the arbor for the times he was too lazy to bring a chair .	1
it had been two months since alejo had visited his family in lima , then flown with them to a medium-sized city in italy , where they would make their new home .	1
since he had come back to rupert 's farm , alejo had been busy studying the bible with rupert and doing odd jobs around the property .	1
usually he was done feeding the huge birds by about five .	1
it was now winter in bolivia , leaving him an hour before sundown to sit out here and think .	1
it was crazy , but a lot of the time he thought about her .	1
he had talked to wara a few times at her parents ' house , short , uneventful conversations that still made him really happy .	1
in only three more weeks , he would see her face-to-face , and they would take a trip together to decide if they would work with ci .	1
as to the destination of the trip , rupert had kept silence , not even wanting to hint .	1
in reality , there were only nineteen days left until alejo would talk with wara in person .	1
less than three weeks .	1
alone behind the grapevines , alejo could n't pretend that he had n't counted the days a few times .	1
besides wara , no one should have the number of the nondescript little cell phone alejo carried in his pocket .	1
so when it rang now , he startled .	1
the number was n't hers , though .	1
alejo warily punched the talk button and pressed an ear to the speaker .	1
`` alejo ?	1
is that you , che ? ''	1
the hairs on alejo 's arm stood on end .	1
`` stalin ? ''	1
`` who else ?	1
oh my goodness , it 's been so long ! ''	1
alejo was stunned .	1
`` how did you get this number ? ''	1
`` relax , che ! ''	1
stalin 's tone was not cautious at all .	1
`` i 'm not with them anymore .	1
i 've run away , to join the circus , as they say .	1
as to how i got this number -- -do n't ask .	1
let 's just say since i 'm the only living member of the prism who knows you 're alive , i 'm the only one who thought to have a look around for you . ''	1
`` you left the prism , '' alejo stated warily , crossing one leg over the other on the five gallon bucket .	1
`` yeah , che , i should have listened to you earlier .	1
after you told me what was going on-about the poor kids being recruited and going over to do holy war-well , i just did n't feel right .	1
and gabriel ? man , i ca n't even talk about that .	1
i still ca n't believe gabo 's gone .	1
but then that day , you know , at pairumani ? ''	1
stalin 's voice cracked and he swore softly .	1
`` alejo , i was a loser and a coward .	1
i just stood there .	1
i let ishmael shoot my best friend for being an infidel . ''	1
alejo found himself grinning , despite the contrition in stalin 's voice .	1
it was so good to hear from a friend .	1
`` yeah , well , there was n't much you could do , '' alejo said .	1
`` we would have been a pretty pair , both lying there with holes in our heads .	1
you did the right thing in the moment .	1
and from what wara tells me , you saved my life later , dropping me off at the hospital . ''	1
alejo could n't bring himself to mention the fact that gabriel had also been there .	1
`` yeah , so what happened to her ? ''	1
stalin asked curiously .	1
`` she go off back to usalandia to live happily ever after with some gringo ? ''	1
alejo snorted .	1
`` yeah , something like that .	1
she certainly was n't about to stay here with me to live happily ever after . ''	1
stalin may be out of the prism , but there 's no way he 's going to get any info out of me about wara .	1
`` so you got out ... what about lzaro and benjamin ? ''	1
`` both sent to another country in south america .	1
they 'll stay out of bolivia for a while , i assume . ''	1
`` and ishmael ? ''	1
alejo asked .	1
`` i have absolutely no idea . ''	1
alejo could picture stalin shaking his head , scraggly hair dragging over his bulky shoulders .	1
`` i hightailed it out of there after we got to asuncion , and took my parents with me .	1
they 're safely tucked away in japan ? i know you wo n't tell . ''	1
the conversation cheered alejo up more than he could have imagined .	1
stalin was alive and well , and possibly dining every evening on sushi and rice .	1
alejo assumed that ishmael khan would n't be showing up in bolivia for some time , after an anonymous call alejo had made explaining that the khan foundation was spiriting away bolivians to fight as mujahedeen , in the name of scholarships and higher education .	1
surprisingly , stalin kept in touch ; a week after his phone call , alejo 's cell shimmered with the alien sound that announced an arriving text from his old friend .	1
`` guess where i am ? ''	1
the little screen read .	1
alejo was debating between `` las vegas '' and `` disneyland '' when a second wave of sound announced stalin 's answer .	1
alejo clicked the sound off and read : `` at mass .	1
yes , that 's right .	1
i 'm sitting here in spain at mass with about five little old ladies . ''	1
then , following quickly , `` and they 're all dressed in black .	1
is that creepy , or what ? ''	1
alejo pulled out the side keyboard , which he had used maybe once , and keyed in , `` despite the creepiness of black , are you finding what you 're looking for ? ''	1
the image of stalin , probably dressed in a t-shirt that accented his beer belly and ratty old jeans , kneeling on the thin wooden rail at the back of the cathedral pew was extremely amusing .	1
it was also fascinating , given the fact that stalin believed he already knew everything about god and had said he would rather have his carnal pleasures .	1
alejo was sure the fact that he was nervously repeating mass along with five wrinkly , age-encrusted spanish women meant that stalin was rethinking whether he was going to pay the price .	1
`` not yet ? there 's something here , but i still do n't know if i 'm ready .	1
but che , i 'm thinking about it . ''	1
another message came .	1
`` i was very impressed with you , willing to die for what you believe . ''	1
alejo hoped this was a good sign .	1
`` but then again , so was gabriel , '' stalin added .	1
`` i 'm still looking , che .	1
god have mercy ? he knows i 'm looking , but the women here in spain are so beautiful ? ''	1
alejo typed , `` do n't you want to talk on the phone ?	1
my fingers are cramping . ''	1
`` ca n't .	1
time to sing .	1
the priest is giving me the eye .	1
talk to you later , alejo . ''	1
alejo slid his phone back in his pocket with a smile and leaned his head back towards the sunshine .	1
34 lilac a country had never seemed so empty and hollow as spain did at that moment to stalin gomez .	1
while mom and dad had their hearts set on a little house in japan , stalin had known immediately upon arriving to get them settled in that japan would never be for him .	1
`` creepy , very creepy '' were the only words that described for him the temples with dull golden statues smiling pacifically at him as he passed .	1
the mlange of slippery sea creatures tacked to wooden planks with wicked looking nails would have been eerie enough at some sort of taxidermy for water creatures display .	1
the fact that it was in a part of the market meant for grocery shopping had given him the heebie-jeebies .	1
with all the money he had pilfered from his bank account , stalin bought his parents a three bedroom house in a cozy neighborhood full of foreigners , a shiny silver lexus , and hired two servants to clean , cook , and fill the house with furniture .	1
then he had gotten back on the plane to a more pleasant destination , planning on sending his parents tickets to come visit .	1
they were n't that old yet , after all .	1
spain seemed like a perfect pick to settle down and hide .	1
it was warm , they spoke spanish , and rumors were that bathing was topless .	1
at first , the city of cordoba , where stalin had rented a nice flat , had seemed very cosmopolitan and smacked of europe .	1
all the excitement soon died away as he found himself lumbering down the gray sidewalks day after day , with no job , no steady girlfriend , and no friends to speak of .	1
the conversation he had with alejo that day in the coffee shop about jesus kept ringing in stalin 's ears , ever since he had realized that for alejo , the whole jesus thing was more than just an intellectual debate about which religion was right .	1
the exact moment stalin had realized this had been when alejo did n't flinch with a gun to his head and had said he would n't change his mind about jesus being god .	1
that had been a very , very heavy day .	1
today , stalin 's heart felt heavy as well , and as he left the massive cathedral where he had been at mass he bought a strawberry ice cream cone from a vendor on the sidewalk .	1
then he turned down one of the ancient , narrow side streets to meander his way in the general direction of home .	1
there really was no hurry ; in spain , no one went to bed before midnight , and at the moment it was just after seven .	1
stalin took a large lick of the sickly-sweet ice cream , the tried to clean a sticky drop of pink off his lips with the paper-thin napkin wrapped around his cone .	1
all of a sudden , he stopped , eyes falling upon a little sign with a picture of a white dove that said libreria la paz .	1
below , in smaller letters , it said , `` libreria evangelica '' .	1
a christian bookstore .	1
and a non-catholic one .	1
something about the store drew stalin towards its rugged stone steps like a piece of lint up the funnel of a vacuum cleaner , but he hesitated .	1
he imagined himself walking into that store to browse books and finding himself swarmed by a pack of hunchbacked crones in black dresses and head coverings , who would then drag him over to a gold-crowned image of the virgin and force him to recite the rosary until he was born again .	1
the glass door squeaked quietly and a little girl wearing a hot pink short set skipped down the steps , followed by a middle-aged guy in a polo shirt who could have been her father .	1
there you go ? people younger than eighty come to this store .	1
maybe it has something for me .	1
realizing he had been holding his breath , stalin drew in a gust of air and then nearly shrieked , feeling the cold drip of melting ice cream soak his fingers .	1
he hurriedly licked all the way around the cold cone , then each finger one by one , glancing around guiltily to see if anyone was watching .	1
finally , stalin pulled himself together and clumped up the stairs to the bookstore , some part of him praying to god that there would be some books here worth reading that could explain to him more about what it was that would n't let him just put jesus at the back of his mind .	1
a bell over the door jangled softly as stalin entered , and he was relieved when the man behind the counter only waved politely at him , then turned away to let the customer browse the shop in peace .	1
it was a small bookstore , with white wooden shelves filled with different titles lining the walls and a small section for music and t-shirts .	1
ignoring everything but the books , stalin began at one end , noticing right away that the volumes seemed to be rather thin .	1
remembering to keep up on licking his ice cream so it would n't flood the bookstore 's red carpet , stalin cocked his head sideways to better scan the titles , getting more disgruntled as he went along .	1
in one section , he found books with titles such as `` a new you in forty days !	1
`` , `` god can control your diet '' , and `` exercising for jesus '' .	1
puzzled , he moved on to the next rows of books and saw several covers featuring blown-up photos of people with white smiles with flashy clothes .	1
`` god wants you to be rich ! ''	1
proclaimed one book with the image of a slick hispanic man in an expensive purple suit .	1
stalin 's brows drew together as he read , `` the ten-day plan to secure wealth '' and `` plant the seed and it will grow '' .	1
a thin rivulet of strawberry ice cream escaped down the side of stalin 's cone and over his hand , splatting onto the carpet below .	1
a curse was on the tip of stalin 's tongue , until he remembered where he was and gulped , glancing over at the man behind the counter .	1
seeing the guy safely reading , paying no attention to stalin soiling his store and cussing , stalin turned back to the books , pretty confused .	1
he had studied christianity in depth during his masters and phd , of course , along with all the other religions .	1
they may not have been the most exciting reading in the world , but he remembered a plethora of thick volumes about theology and christian thought .	1
those books were not just a little weighty ; they were the kind you could use for weight-lifting around the house , if you ever did such a thing .	1
where were those kinds of books here ?	1
the shiny books stalin saw lined up around this bookstore seemed to be about anything except christianity .	1
was n't there anything here that just told about jesus ?	1
plop !	1
stalin stared in horror as the mushy pink mound that was left on top of his cone slid onto the floor with one fluid motion , falling with a soundless whoosh onto the cherry red carpet .	1
now he did swear , albeit under his breath , then jerked his head up as he heard a soft chuckle , coming from nearby .	1
spiky , white high heels turned into long legs , then a flowery skirt and a tight , lilac-colored jacket .	1
in front of stalin stood the most beautiful woman he had ever seen-and that was saying a lot .	1
her hair fell to her waist , and was chestnut brown with shimmers of red .	1
with twinkling eyes , the woman was regarding stalin with amusement : first his face , which he intuited must be a shade between lobster and beet red , and then the flattened pile of melting ice cream staining the carpet .	1
`` too hot for ice cream today , '' she remarked , and then twisted her waist gracefully to pull a packet of tissues out of her purse .	1
`` do n't worry ; this carpet is so worn no one will ever notice . ''	1
and just like that , she scooped up the fallen ice cream with a wad of tissues and tossed it into a trash can standing against a pillar in the middle of the small room .	1
stalin felt his mouth hang open as she raised her hand and he saw long , perfectly-manicured nails painted lilac and silver .	1
most importantly of all , he saw no wedding band .	1
`` i 'm shannon , '' the amazing creature said , holding out one perfect hand towards stalin .	1
`` my father always loved ireland so he gave me an irish name . ''	1
her accent told stalin she was all spanish , however .	1
he forced himself to close his mouth and reached out to shake her hand with one of his own sticky ones .	1
many smooth things to say flooded stalin 's mind at the moment , but unexpectedly , all of them seemed out of place here in the middle of this christian bookstore , surrounded by the surreal sound of churchy music floating from a stereo .	1
instead , he said , `` do n't they have any books here that talk about something ? serious ?	1
i feel like i 'm in the self-help section of some bookstore .	1
where can i find books about something like ? the atonement , for example .	1
or the theological arguments for why jesus was divine . ''	1
stalin found himself taken aback when shannon chuckled again , a deep , full-throated laugh .	1
`` you wo n't find anything like that in here , '' she said in a conspiratorial tone .	1
`` if that 's what you 're after , the man you want to talk to is my father . ''	1
stalin blinked in surprise .	1
`` he 's the pastor of an evangelical church here , '' she explained , `` but he 's also quite a scholar .	1
my daddy has written three books , and he has a whole room for a library with all kinds of fat books about everything you can imagine .	1
there are a lot about the atonement . ''	1
stalin felt himself staring .	1
`` have you ever read any of them ? ''	1
`` a few , '' shannon flicked her hand dismissively .	1
`` ok , quite a few .	1
i 'm working my way through them .	1
i 'm getting my phd now and my thesis is quite ? theological .	1
so i get some studying time in , yes . ''	1
shannon pulled a purple cell phone out of her purse and glanced at the time .	1
`` daddy 's waiting for me at home now , so i 've really got to go . ''	1
heart sinking , stalin pressed his lips together so his jaw would n't hang open again , gawking at shannon .	1
then , in a magical , wonderful moment of awe , stalin saw shannon 's full lips open again and the words that she said were : `` why do n't you come home for dinner tonight ?	1
a guy like you , interested in learning more about jesus and theology ? my daddy would love to talk to you . ''	1
stalin felt as though the flaming arrow of cupid had pierced his chest .	1
`` i 've really got to run , though , so make up your mind quick . ''	1
shannon placed the phone into her purse and half-turned towards the door , beginning to walk out .	1
stalin took in the skirt , the legs , the high heels , and one millisecond was all it took for him to propel himself forward , like a dog hooked to a leash , towards shannon and her daddy the pastor who would tell him all about jesus .	1
the end s 0 cotton candy sky tehran , iran , 2017 to sami , the white-hot explosion of sun that staggered him as the blindfold was ripped from his eyes was more brilliant than the glory of any starry spotlight where adoring fans screamed his name .	1
a rubber boot connected with his back as the rush of light hit his wide-open eyes , slamming him to the pavement .	1
rivers of radiant colors stormed his vision as sami lifted his head , and he vaguely made out the city park and the crowds gathered , absolutely silent .	1
his life had been lived surrounded by multitudes , but today no one reached frenzied hands towards him in the hope that his own fingers would briefly connect with theirs between wild chords strummed on the electric guitar .	1
no one was rapturously snapping photos of him with their cell phone camera , plotting to show the blurry concert images to their friends .	1
sami 's eyes cleared enough to realize that he was encircled by uniformed police bearing the thick plexiglas shields that were synonymous with riot control .	1
they formed a writhing barrier between him and the crowd , an ominous warning to anyone who tried to capture the scene on a cell phone camera .	1
but still the crowds stayed , fixed eerily in place behind the police line , silent .	1
for nearly ten years sami had heard his fans ' hysteric screams and cheers , accorded to him as the lead singer of iran 's most popular rock band , ashavan .	1
today , under a baby blue sky sprayed with cotton-candy clouds , the last sound sami would hear from those fans , warily planted behind the police in the park , was their silence .	1
today , while children raced up the slide in the distance and the ice cream man with his cart strolled by gaping , sami would be publicly beheaded .	1
kneeling on the asphalt , sami closed his eyes and felt as if he were watching himself from the sky , only a spectator to this gruesomely comic event : a thirty-year-old literature major-turned-rock star , sentenced to beheading in the park for a list of unpleasant crimes .	1
but sami knew why he was really here .	1
something rustled behind him and sami snapped back to reality .	1
a guard yanked on the cuffs around his wrists , checking if his arms were secured .	1
sami 's ankles were also chained together , as they had often been in the four months he had spent in the maximum security prison .	1
`` get up , '' the guard ordered , dragging him to his feet .	1
a slimy smudge of perspiration marred the young guard 's right eyebrow as he avoided the prisoner 's eyes .	1
it was more than obvious he did n't want to be here .	1
`` over there . ''	1
a dozen feet away , circled by a dreary ring of hoary stones , a cement block protruded from the park square .	1
a murky stain began at its heart , spreading snaking tentacles across the surface of the block and down its sides : lifeblood , spilled here under the sun after afternoon prayers in the past .	1
sami stumbled to his bare feet , barely aware of the sensation of his soles on the burning pavement .	1
once he had worn trendy italian leather shoes and jeans from paris that had cost three hundred euros .	1
today , sami 's feet were bare and bleeding .	1
he wore tattered cotton pants , stained from the floor of his cell , and a simple white t-shirt .	1
the shirt hung loosely over his frame , muscles wasted away from days of doing nothing but praying in his cell instead of working out at an elite gym club .	1
even so , he still towered over the two guards at his side , tall and broad-shouldered .	1
a collective gasp rise up from the myriad of dark eyes staring at him in the park and sami thought that probably the people gathered here today barely recognized him .	1
sami did n't mind .	1
the old sami was gone , and he was a different person now .	1
the new sami did n't mind standing barefoot in dirty white , sans ray-bans and without beautiful women following his every move .	1
in a few minutes he would be dressed in pure white , screaming the name of the one who had made him able to sing in the first place .	1
`` c'mon .	1
i 'm sorry . ''	1
the young , sweaty guard who had a death grip on sami 's arm was named hourmazd .	1
`` they 're waiting , '' hourmazd said reluctantly .	1
`` you have to come now . ''	1
sami felt his feet slap across the hot , soiled square in slow motion .	1
next to the chipped concrete chopping block , the executioner waited in a crisp black uniform and aviator ray-bans , gripping a saudi arabian scimitar .	1
at attention a few steps behind , two doctors in white coats stood watching the proceedings .	1
one of them held a dove gray tarp , folded neat and square ; this would be to wrap sami 's body .	1
at the prison , it had been explained to him that after the beheading his body and head would be carried off by the doctors , who would then reattach the two items and bury sami in full accordance with islamic burial laws .	1
none of sami 's family had any intentions of burying their wayward relative in the christian manner .	1
at the moment , whether his dead body would be laid in the ground facing mecca or not was the last thing on sami 's mind .	1
standing before the executioner 's block , sami 's eyes blazed across the gathered crowd one last time , not surprised to see neither his mother nor his father here to witness the gory sight .	1
several feet behind one of the policemen 's opaque shields , a pale face peeped out from under a nondescript black chador veil .	1
she came .	1
sami 's heart surged within him and he stared at her , taking in the last beauty he would ever see in this place called earth .	1
he met her weeping eyes calmly , intensely begging her not to cry and give herself away .	1
i 'll see you again , my sister .	1
and then time for scanning the solemn crowd was up ; hourmazd and the other guard forced sami to his knees .	1
hot fingers grabbed his temple like a vise , twisting his head to one side , plastering one cheek against the icy concrete .	1
a filmy coating of dust and pebbles had settled onto the block , and sami 's hand instinctively jerked forward to swipe the scratchy debris off his cheek , then pulled up short against the biting metal cuffs .	1
urgent hands still held him down , kneeling , and sami realized he was facing the crowd , saw that ava was looking up towards heaven .	1
i could have married you .	1
sami swallowed and his adam 's apple grazed the abrasive stone .	1
we could have gone away to germany or canada together .	1
we could have had six or seven little iranian babies , who would have grown up hearing about jesus every day and playing whatever kind of music they wanted , for him .	1
you would end up wide-hipped and disheveled from all those children , and i would get bald and wrinkly .	1
but we would sit together by the fireplace every night with our children , singing with the guitar and loving each other .	1
a ream of black cloth descended in front of sami 's vision and cinched in a hard knot behind his skull .	1
the blindfold pressed his lashes tightly against his cheeks , leaving him blind , each beat of his heart echoing slowly in the darkness .	1
the pressure of the hands against his head and back disappeared and an unearthly hush descended upon the park .	1
the charges against him were read out loud , a list of things sami could never imagine becoming .	1
rape .	1
treason .	1
worship of satan a mullah began to pray loudly in arabic , and sami waited with his temple to the icy block .	1
in prison he had been warned ; if he moved , the blade could miss and he would n't be killed at the first fall of the scimitar .	1
a dove cooed overhead .	1
heart pounding in his chest , sami waited in the darkness , knowing that in just a minute more he would see the light .	1
1 karate gone bad she laid the guitar case on the smooth tree stump among the pines and cried , knowing only the trees would hear .	1
a few tears later she stopped , scrubbing her face on her soft tiered skirt , never one for prolonged weeping .	1
she let her eyes run over the battered case , balanced on the ancient stump like an offering , then carefully opened the dented clasps .	1
the honey-colored taylor guitar still nestled in emerald velvet .	1
this had been noah 's guitar .	1
wara sniffed loudly and smiled , remembered him grinning from the stool at the front of the caf , playing this guitar and singing his heart out .	1
she cradled the taylor across her lap and began to pick her way through a few chords .	1
it had been three months , and it still hurt .	1
his arm had been around wara when the bus went over the ravine , but she was thrown out the window to safety .	1
noah had n't made it .	1
since then she had been here in montana , living with her parents on the ranch that was her childhood home .	1
life as a missionary in bolivia was over , dreams smashed to pieces with the shattered glass of the bus where noah died .	1
a new chapter was about to begin , and honestly , wara really did n't think she was ready .	1
staying here on the bench in the little sheltering circle of trees on the ranch was sounding better and better all the time .	1
a sharp crack sounded in the foliage .	1
wara tensed and huddled into the comforting familiarity of the guitar , totally aware that her reaction to the sound was overkill .	1
this was a ranch , after all .	1
squirrels and birds did live in the trees that surrounded her , and yellowed leaves were constantly crunching their way to the ground now that fall was in full swing .	1
but after the bus accident in bolivia she had been kidnapped and nearly killed by the muslim group who had bombed her bus .	1
so unexpected sounds made her a little nervous .	1
that was ok , was n't it ?	1
`` holy cow ! ''	1
she shrieked without meaning to , nearly dropping the guitar on her toes .	1
because all of a sudden , defying her expectations that the little noise would end up being a stray squirrel scuttling around in the trees , a solid male figure emerged from the shadows .	1
she fizzled with adrenaline , vision full of a broad-shouldered man , skin the color of a mocha latte , wearing a black shirt and brown corduroys .	1
`` holy cow ! ''	1
she gasped again , less fear and more irritation lacing her voice now .	1
the intruder was now out of the shadows , holding up two tan hands in a gesture meant to calm her down .	1
the dark curls that had hung around his collar were gone , but those clear hazel eyes were unmistakable .	1
all the seven martir children had them .	1
`` wara .	1
it 's me , '' he said , only adding more fuel to the storm of adrenaline and annoyance lashing her insides .	1
alejo martir .	1
was here .	1
at her house in montana .	1
the ex-leader of the prism , the group that tried to kill her .	1
he had been behind the bomb that killed noah on the bus .	1
and then he had left everything to behind to save wara .	1
`` you ? you scared the beejeebers out of me ! ''	1
she managed , feeling herself scowl .	1
she had never imagined she would see him here .	1
sure , in bolivia they had both been recruited by a man named rupert to work with an organization called ci .	1
wara had known she would see alejo again , next week when they set off on an exploratory trip to make their final decision about working with ci in the future .	1
but for goodness sake , she was supposed to have the weekend still to deal with this before seeing alejo again !	1
`` what are you doing here ? ''	1
she demanded .	1
yes , this was the friendly midwest , but wara recognized not the tiniest hint of welcome in her voice .	1
now , she was just plain irate .	1
and scared .	1
some of the spark in alejo 's hazel eyes faded .	1
`` last week we said we 'd meet up on the trip , since we 're both headed the same way .	1
and in bolivia i said i 'd find you .	1
and here you are .	1
in montana . ''	1
well .	1
because alejo had asked her to forgive him , they 'd talked on the phone for a few minutes every couple weeks since bolivia .	1
it gave wara the opportunity to say something decent to the brother of her best friend nazaret , instead of simmering with anger and resentment towards him for what he had done .	1
`` see you soon , then , '' alejo had said over her cell a week ago .	1
`` i-i 'm sorry , '' wara exhaled slowly and closed her eyes .	1
they opened to alejo crossing the space between them tentatively , then offering a hand in greeting .	1
they cheek-smooched mechanically , bolivian-style , and alejo cautiously took a seat on the other extreme of the bench .	1
he looked younger with his hair shaved , face smoothed of many of the tortured lines that had marked it three months earlier .	1
the light in his eye flickered , begging wara to let it come back to life as she had promised him through forgiveness after what he 'd done .	1
she could let the light live , or blow it back out .	1
her heart hurt as she crossed her arms over her gray henley top and tried the hint of a smile .	1
`` i 'm ? really sorry .	1
i just really was n't expecting you . ''	1
`` i know , '' alejo 's lips twisted into a smile .	1
`` i just thought i 'd drop by so we could take the trip to morocco together .	1
i could carry your stuff .	1
and i , uh , thought i could see where you live , maybe meet your parents . ''	1
wara fought for polite words , all the while nearly swallowing her tongue .	1
`` meet my parents ? ''	1
she blinked hard against the memory of alejo 's first connecting with her face , the sudden gravity as she spun into the dirt and collapsed .	1
alejo pressing the hunting knife to her throat and dragging her into the forest .	1
this guy was a killer .	1
and her best friend nazaret 's brother .	1
and , insanely , her possible future co-worker .	1
a little panicked , her gaze flitted around her little sanctuary of trees , the cedar bench that had been there as long as she could remember .	1
beyond was the house she had always known , her childhood bedroom , the living room where she 'd ripped open presents on christmas and drank coffee over a good novel .	1
`` ok , '' she blurted .	1
`` my parents are n't here now , though .	1
they 're both still at work . ''	1
`` fine . ''	1
alejo leaned back into the bench , seemingly content just taking in the shades of changing autumn leaves .	1
wara suddenly felt smothered , faced with the prospect of the next several days of his company .	1
what in the world were they supposed to talk about ?	1
she eyed him sideways , but he just sat there with that zen-like tranquility , meditating on nature .	1
it was making her crazy .	1
`` i 've been taking karate .	1
per your instructions , '' she informed him just to break the silence .	1
alejo 's eyes lit up in surprise and he tore his gaze from the nearly-naked trees .	1
`` good .	1
i hope you never have to get in a fight , but i feel better knowing you 're learning some tricks to keep up your sleeve . ''	1
alejo raised one eyebrow and grinned dangerously as he eyed wara 's long plaid skirt .	1
`` think you can show me some of what you 've learned ?	1
in that ? ''	1
`` why not . ''	1
wara frowned .	1
`` right now ?	1
like , fight with you ?	1
are you serious ? ''	1
`` sure .	1
i 've got to see if you 've been slacking . ''	1
his tone softened , and wara suspected he did n't really think she had learned anything but had only assigned her to learn martial arts to keep her mind off the unpleasant past .	1
`` besides , '' alejo 's tone was quiet yet challenging .	1
`` i do n't think you 'll turn down the chance to give me a few good kicks . ''	1
suddenly he was off the bench and a few feet away , feet planted firmly on the ground .	1
`` c'mon , do n't be nice . ''	1
arching an eyebrow that said she really did n't plan to be , wara slowly stood up , pulling a rubber band off her wrist to twist her hair into a rough ponytail .	1
in the three months since she had left bolivia , her dark hair was growing long and straight , looking a little more polished than the uneven cut she had sported before .	1
`` now , '' alejo was grinning solemnly , `` i do n't want to be too mean to you , either , since this is our first fight .	1
so for today i 'm just going to use beginner skills .	1
just show me what you 've got . ''	1
with that , alejo sidestepped around towards her back so fast she barely had time to register that he was going to try to grab her from behind .	1
whoa !	1
not ready !	1
wara 's eyes widened as she racked her mind for what she was supposed to do in this situation .	1
she had been going to classes every stinking day , after all .	1
even if alejo had told her to do karate to make her feel better , it had worked .	1
whacking and kicking things had ended up to be a very entertaining way to spend the last there months .	1
the correct kick flashed into her mind as she was already beginning to execute it out of instinct .	1
she managed to twist away from alejo just in time , feeling the thickness of his arms brush by her cheek .	1
ha ha !	1
apparently all the hours of practice were paying off !	1
but now alejo was coming at her again , ready to take a swing at her head .	1
moving easily , wara ducked to the left just in time , then rolled to the ground and shot a strong kick upward , barely missing alejo 's belly .	1
it appeared her muscles really were stronger from all those hours spent at okinawa karate studio .	1
`` man ! ''	1
he eyed her with something she could almost call appreciation .	1
`` you 're fast .	1
you could hold me off for a while with those lightning kicks .	1
unfortunately , because i 'm bigger , i can do this . ''	1
before she even knew how it happened , he had hauled her to her feet and had her against a near-by tree .	1
there was no way she could escape his weight , and his steely grip on her elbows tightened painfully if she even attempted to move .	1
`` no , no ! ''	1
she shrieked , feeling the rage of losing and the powerlessness of not being able to do a thing about it .	1
blame it on being an only child , but wara hated losing .	1
`` get off of me ! ''	1
she grunted , and flung her head backwards just where she imagined alejo 's eye socket should be .	1
she actually saw a few white stars as her skull connected with his face , but the satisfaction of hearing him swear under his breath was more than worth it .	1
but that was her last move .	1
the hold on her elbows tightened even more , and alejo pressed her farther into the tree , his cheek plastered against hers .	1
`` ok , you win , '' she pronounced , speaking carefully since her lips were only centimeters from the tree bark .	1
`` you did really well , though . ''	1
the hiss of alejo 's breath in her ear was quite annoying .	1
`` i 'll show you how to do this hold i 've got your arms in .	1
someday , i hope you 'll be able to kick my rear in a fight ? well , at least if i have the flu . ''	1
wara glared , hoping he could see her scowl from the side as he pulled away from her and released the death hold on her arms .	1
a sharp crack sounded in the clearing .	1
wara 's gaze jerked upward as a flurry of dust and bark rained down on her head with the dull whap of an object slamming into the tree above her .	1
`` down ! ''	1
alejo growled into her ear .	1
her knees buckled as his weight slammed into her and they crashed to the ground .	1
her first thought was : it 's a bullet .	1
someone is shooting at us !	1
alejo remained on top of her , and she flipped her head towards the source of the sound , more than a little frantic .	1
surreally , alejo had whipped out a gun and was in position to shoot anything that came into sight from behind the trees .	1
but instead of another bullet , a low voice cut through the clearing .	1
`` get away from her , or you 're a dead man .	1
next time i wo n't miss . ''	1
wara 's mind fuzzed over , unbelieving .	1
this could not be happening .	1
alejo 's forearm tensed around the gun as a lanky man in a denim jacket appeared , half-sheltered behind a golden oak tree .	1
his eyes narrowed and he trained an unwavering shotgun exactly at alejo 's head .	1
`` do n't shoot ! ''	1
wara screamed at the man holding the gun .	1
`` it 's ok ! !	1
do n't shoot ! ''	1
she elbowed alejo roughly , face sizzling with chagrin .	1
`` get off ! ''	1
she gasped .	1
`` i ca n't breathe !	1
he wo n't shoot us ? it 's just my dad . ''	1

christopher david petersen copyright 2011 christopher david petersen smashwords edition climbing on longs peak the diamond , estes park co ( im the dark spot 1500 ft above the valley ) see that photo above thats just before all hell broke loose while climbing on longs peak in estes park , colorado .	1
now , i hate to be one for over-drama , but when i say all hell broke loose , im talking fire and brimstone kinda hell .	1
some quick background first : at the point in the photo that my friend isaac had taken the picture , we had been climbing for nearly twelve hours and were now roughly 1500 feet above the valley floor .	1
we had started up a steep snow face well before dawn and after day break , the skies looked clear and the winds were light .	1
it was really a beautiful day .	1
by mid-morning , that had all changed .	1
the skies clouded over and with it , brought winds , plummeting temperatures and light snow .	1
no biggie , right ?	1
you say for most mountaineers , a few flurries normally wouldnt increase the pucker factor .	1
i wont go into the definition of pucker factor but trust me , a high pucker factor really is not good .	1
as it was , we were looking at a low pf , so i really wasnt too worried , but i did keep a watchful eye on the deteriorating conditions .	1
shortly after that photo , all hell broke loose .	1
the skies became angry and violent .	1
the temperatures hovered around zero and the light snow opened up into a full blown blizzard .	1
as the snows accumulated in the upper reaches of the mountain , huge pockets of that light fluffy white stuff would break loose and race down the cliff in the form of spindrift avalanches .	1
aside from the obvious ( death ) , spindrift avalanches really suck because all too frequently , they pour off the upper face above you and down the back of your neck .	1
has anyone every dropped an ice cube down your back ?	1
well , that would be a welcome relief to a pile of snow .	1
fortunately , due to my superior intellect , i was able to recognize the repetitive event after only being caught in them five times .	1
before the sixth dowsing of snow , i pulled my hood over my head .	1
i know , i know pure genius .	1
isaacs and my plan for the climb was simple .	1
we had planned to traverse the cliff a hundred feet more ( from that point in the photo ) , then climb the upper rock face of the diamond for fifty feet or so , then climb onto a steep snow slope above .	1
once we reached that snow slope , it would be easy ( but dangerous ) climbing to the summit .	1
no problemo right ?	1
or so we thought .	1
i have to admit .	1
by the time we were making that traverse to the diamond , i was tired .	1
i hadnt worked on my conditioning as well as i should have prior to the climb and the higher elevations were really wearing me out .	1
to make matters worse , i didnt bring enough food or water , so my energy reserves were pretty low .	1
to my relief , isaac led the traverse while i hung back and paid out the rope .	1
it felt good to hang off the cliff by a bunch of tiny slings instead of making that dangerous traverse , out on the sharp end of the rope as its called in climbing .	1
i hung under a large block that sheltered me from the spindrift avalanches above , while i watched isaac pick his way across the cliff .	1
little by little , he alternated his hands and feet as he moved sideways , relying on the hand and footholds to hold him to the steep cliff .	1
hanging there in the cold , the winds howled .	1
i could feel the energy draining from my body by the minute .	1
i shivered uncontrollably now and shook out each hand to knock some warmth back into them .	1
time seemed to move so slowly as i watched isaac cross that traverse .	1
every so often , isaac placed a piece of climbing gear into the rocks and threaded the rope through it .	1
if he fell , hed only drop the length past the climbing gear instead 1500 feet below .	1
halfway across the traverse , isaac stopped .	1
he was now at a point called the notch couloir .	1
the notch couloir was a wide break in the cliff that ran nearly to the top of the mountain .	1
it was far less steep and if viewing it from a distance , it could even be considered a mini-valley carved at the top of the cliff .	1
i watched isaac stand like a statue , far out in front of me .	1
he didnt move .	1
he didnt look up .	1
he didnt look around .	1
he just stared straight ahead .	1
come on , sally .	1
grow some balls and move .	1
im freakin freezen here , i remember thinking to myself as i watched him stand idly by .	1
just then , the world went white before me .	1
an enormous spindrift avalanche careened off the cliff face above me and completely blocked my view of isaac .	1
holy mackeral , i yelled out only i didnt say mackerel .	1
no sir , that was a lot of snow , enough to fill up a couple of very large houses .	1
i felt the rope go taut and pulled hard to take up the slack .	1
i was scared .	1
i could feel that sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach as i envisioned isaac being swept over the cliff by the avalanche .	1
a moment later , as the last of the snowy dust floated on by , i could see him .	1
there was isaac : still standing where i saw him last .	1
the rope had only gone taut due to the weight of the snow as it rushed over it .	1
isaac had not been swept away .	1
dude , you see that ?	1
i yelled out to isaac , but he never heard me .	1
i saw isaac look up toward the notch couloir , then shuffle quickly across .	1
facing the mountain , he moved his right foot to his right , then moved his left foot over to match it .	1
over and over , isaac repeated the sequence , shuffling across the cliff as he continued to stare up toward the top .	1
as he moved , i paid out the rope , holding him in case he lost his footing and slipped off the edge of the cliff .	1
i was his lifeline , but i had no idea if i could hold his weight in the event of a fall .	1
watching him cross , i looked down the full length of the 1500 foot cliff .	1
we were high .	1
due to the deteriorating conditions , we needed to move faster and place less gear on the route for protection during a fall .	1
i hadnt really thought about it before , but having time to analyze the scene , i now realized that a fall over that cliff could almost certainly rip me from my stance .	1
i felt damned scared , but buried my fears and concentrated on my job .	1
moments later , isaac made it to the other side of the snowy slope .	1
suddenly , i heard a loud whooosh .	1
isaac was gone again .	1
i pulled hard on the rope and locked off my belaying device .	1
then i saw it through the falling snow .	1
the mother of all spindrift avalanches creating a white cloud of snow that rushed down the snowy face and over the cliff .	1
oh crap !	1
i remember saying in my mind , but again , i didnt say crap .	1
i braced myself again for the tug that i figured would be isaac .	1
seconds later , the rope went slack .	1
as the snow clear out , there was isaac , still clinging to the rocks on the other side of the snow slope and he was grinning ear to ear .	1
duuude , did you see that ?	1
isaac yelled across the cliff face to me .	1
the rush of beating the tempest had his adrenaline pumping .	1
i could see he was scared , yet invigorated .	1
ok man , youre up next , he yelled out to me .	1
a sick feeling swept over me .	1
it was indeed my turn to run the gauntlet .	1
i looked around me in a futile attempt to avoid the inevitable , but finally isaac yelled back over to me again .	1
duuude , you got ta hurry .	1
lets go , he yelled out to me with deep impatience in his voice .	1
quickly i dismantled the anchors holding me to the mountain and started my way across the rock and snowy cliff .	1
hand over hand , i reached for anything that i could grab , each time , double checking that isaac was taking up the slack .	1
the rocky face was cold and now had a light dusting of snow on it .	1
my thin polypropylene gloves were great when the temps were in the forties , but now the temps were hovering around zero , rendering the gloves almost useless .	1
my fingers were so cold , they were cramping as i reached for my next handhold .	1
i was now become increasingly worried i wasnt going to be able to hold on much longer .	1
my survival instincts kicked in and i dug deep .	1
throwing caution to the wind , i decided to make risky moves across the cliff face , hoping my hands wouldnt fail before reaching the snowy slope of the notch couloir .	1
i moved quickly and deliberately , but with awkward lunges that continually held me off balance .	1
my heart was pumping and i could feel the anxiety building as i closed the distance on the snowy slope to my right .	1
a minute later , as my hands were giving out , i made my final step onto the snow slope where i fell forward and rested .	1
good job dude , now cross the couloir , i heard isaac yell to me as i lay and rested .	1
as if in a dream state , i heard him yell to me , and you got ta time the avalanches .	1
what ?	1
i yelled out in disbelief .	1
up till that moment , i hadnt realized the amount of snow that had been falling .	1
at some point out on that cliff , the snow increased in intensity from heavy to savage .	1
the snowflakes were large and accumulating at a rate of nearly two feet an hour .	1
with that much unstable snow above us , the spindrift avalanches were now rolling down the notch couloir every fifteen seconds .	1
crossing the 50 feet wide couloir would take all of that fifteen seconds , if you moved fast .	1
if you didnt , the result could be disastrous .	1
that much snow could easily sweep you off and over the cliff .	1
perfect , i remember saying to myself .	1
no sooner than i wisecracked , i watched a wall of snow barreling down at me as it roared through the snow slopes narrow valley above .	1
quickly , i dug my hands and feet into the snow and hung on .	1
i watched for only a moment , then just before impact , i buried my head down into my shoulders and braced myself for the terrifying wave of snow .	1
at first , the snow flowed over me like a gentle stream of water , but that didnt last long .	1
a split second later , i felt the full force of the wall of snow that raged over the top of me .	1
it taunted me , laughed at me , mocked my insignificant strength as it pushed and dragged me lower from my dug-in position .	1
i could feel my hands and feet being ripped from their anchors and i focused all my energy on them , trying to embed them further in the hard packed snow .	1
as i began to slide , i felt the unmistakable tug of the rope on my climbers harness yanking me sideways as isaac fought to keep that malevolent force from dragging me off the cliff .	1
nooo , i remember screaming in my mind as my feet broke free of solid land and floated in space .	1
i was going over the cliff edge the cliff edge that perched 1500 feet above the world .	1
this was really going to suck .	1
suddenly , all went quiet .	1
as quickly as the avalanche came , it went .	1
i immediately crawled higher and leapt to my feet .	1
i gave a cursory glance at the cliff edge just inches below me , then over at isaac .	1
he was smiling duuuude , you almost cratered , man !	1
he yelled to me .	1
then he added , lets go , now !	1
i knew i had only seconds before the next wave of snow came .	1
isaac pulled hard on the rope , snapping me out of my foggy state and i started off across the open snow slope .	1
the snow was deep now , almost past my knees and i dug deep into my reserves to plow through the heavy mess .	1
forty feet , thirty feet , twenty feet i powered across the slope like a steaming locomotive , focusing only onmy destination .	1
i saw isaac look upward and i knew disaster was on its way .	1
harder and more determined , i plowed across the last feet steps .	1
twenty feet , ten feet , then i heard the roar of the wave from above .	1
i looked up and saw the next wall of snow roiling as it charged down the snow slope .	1
suddenly , i felt a hard jerk on my jacket , only it wasnt from above it was sideways .	1
isaac reached out , grabbed my jacket and hauled me into safety .	1
i looked back and watched my deep footprints vanish in a moments blink as the heavy wall of snow obliterated any signs of my existence .	1
dude man , you were almost a statistic pretty cool , huh ?	1
isaac yelled to me over the roar of the avalanche .	1
yeah cool , i replied grimly .	1
isaac had set up a bomber anchor system and for the moment , i felt fairly secure .	1
i looked over to isaac and he was now looking at a rock wall behind us .	1
ok man , we got ta climb up this rocky face , then step around the corner to the diamond .	1
thats where it gets a little sketchy .	1
well do that short pitch of rock , then step off that and onto the snow slope above .	1
sound ok ?	1
i remember isaac asking me .	1
i remember in my mind saying , hell no , its not ok. im cold , tired , scared and im pretty sure i need a new change of under-britches .	1
yup , i replied dryly through gritted teeth .	1
what were we thinking ?	1
the freakin diamond on longs peak in the middle of winter what were we , insane ? ! !	1
whats the diamond you ask ?	1
only the mother of all rock faces in colorado .	1
its nearly 2000 feet of sheer and overhanging rock , that only the best and most skilled climbers attempt to climb .	1
fortunately , we were only planning on doing the very last fifty feet of it .	1
at least that was the plan .	1
that last section was supposed to be relatively easy climbing , but now , it was getting dark and the snows were really accumulating on the rocky surfaces that we were depending on for handholds .	1
hold me , i want to check out the diamond , isaac said to me .	1
i paid out the rope as he worked his way lower toward the cliffs edge .	1
once there , he grabbed a rocky handhold and extended himself out over the 1500 foot drop off .	1
he looked down for a moment , then to his left to survey the upper face that we were about to climb .	1
he stared at it for what felt like an eternity .	1
well ?	1
i shouted out over the howling winds .	1
isaac pulled himself back over land and worked his way back up to me .	1
no way , man it aint happening .	1
that whole face is covered in snow , isaac said .	1
we got ta find another way up .	1
any suggestions ?	1
yeah , sh # t my pants , then use my ice axes to climb up the snowy mess in front of us , i suggested .	1
isaac looked up at the wall of snow , rock and ice that stood between us and the upper snow slope twenty feet higher .	1
if we could just get above it , the summit would only be a few hundred feet more of easy snow climbing .	1
isaac turned to me and said , ok , after sh # tting your pants , go for .	1
i done sh # tting you got me , i replied dryly .	1
i took out my ice axes , looped the lanyards around my wrists and approached the mess in front of me .	1
for those who dont know what an ice axe is , it is a miniature pick axe .	1
you swing the pick into ice and pull on the handle to climb higher .	1
its that simple .	1
i brushed the heavy snow off the rocks and searched for a handhold .	1
as i placed my hand on a nice blocky surface , it quickly slid off .	1
ice a thin layer of ice had now glazed the rocks surfaces .	1
it was no use .	1
using my hands alone just wasnt going to work .	1
undaunted , i decided to use the pick of my ice axes to try to climb higher .	1
i placed the front point into a tiny crack and pulled hard .	1
it held .	1
i pulled on the axe handle and moved higher as isaac paid out the rope .	1
this was scary climbing , with a pf ( pucker factor ) of about an 8 .	1
ice axes are used for thick ice where the front point of the axe sinks deep into ice , giving you a secure hold .	1
now , my axes front points were only held to the rock by shear gravity .	1
if i moved the wrong way , they could easily just pop off the rock and id fall not good .	1
i moved up a few feet to the outer corner where the blocky face above met the face of the diamond .	1
gingerly , i placed my axes on the glazed rocks and pulled hard , trying to get them to stick .	1
i then peered out around the corner .	1
isaac was right .	1
that diamond was literally covered in snow .	1
i looked up at the corner i was now climbing .	1
a few feet higher , it appeared that the texture became more blocky and easier to climb .	1
the problem was that id have to straddle the corner with one leg on the blocky face and the other on the face of the diamond .	1
id be hanging , literally , 1500 feet above the valley floor by only the tiny points of my axes .	1
got me ?	1
i yelled to isaac over the winds .	1
isaac must have seen the fear in my eyes .	1
he smiled encouragingly and yelled , youll be ok. my stomach churned as i looked down through the falling snow .	1
it was almost dark and i could barely see the large blocks of snow on the valley floor , far below .	1
my hands sweated even while they froze to the axe handles .	1
i was scared damned scared !	1
pf = 10 i reached up and scraped off some snow above me , looking for a good placement .	1
feeling around , i located a tiny crack and slipped the point of the axe into it .	1
as i weighted it , i moved my right foot out onto the diamonds face .	1
with half my body hanging out over 1500 feet of air , i was now straddling the hairy edge of my raging fear .	1
i didnt want to look down i couldnt really .	1
something in my subconscious mind wouldnt allow me to do it .	1
suddenly , a wild blast of arctic wind slammed into my body , rocking me from my stance .	1
my feet skidded momentarily , then one popped off its placement .	1
quickly , i found another foot hold , but then again , another gust of wind slammed into me , knocking both feet loose .	1
in an instant , i was now dangling from my ice axes over the 1500 foot cliff , swinging wildly in the wind .	1
fear roiled inside me .	1
i lost my breath as i frantically searched with my feat for any type of purchase .	1
fumbling , freaking and fatiguing , i was running out of strength and running out of time .	1
i needed a miracle .	1
bam !	1
another gust broadsided me .	1
my left axe wobbled and popped out of its feeble placement .	1
oh my god !	1
i remember saying to myself .	1
is this it ?	1
is this how im going to die ?	1
i felt a tug then another .	1
isaac anticipated my fall and was now doing his best to reel in what little slack in the rope he could find .	1
i felt my body lunge sideways toward him .	1
he was nearly pulling me off the cliff .	1
as i flailed in the air , i made a desperate attempt to hook my axe on anything that would hold .	1
isaac tugged again and drew me in from the corner .	1
i reached for the blocky face and i scrambled my feet to find something to stand on below .	1
suddenly , my foot found something a nob , a tiny nob .	1
i stepped on it and immediately pushed hard forcing me closing to isaac .	1
for a moment it held then it didnt .	1
i sprung from the cliff once more , dangling again , wildly thrashing in the wind .	1
i could feel the veins in my neck pulsating with savage fear .	1
what felt like hours were mere seconds but it was enough to drain me of all mental and physical strength .	1
i could barely hold on any longer .	1
isaac tugged hard .	1
i made another desperate lung with my free hand .	1
the axe caught an edge and stuck .	1
my feet found a stance .	1
for a moment , it was over .	1
i found a respite .	1
isaac had somehow hauled me off the face of the diamond , pulled me around the corner and i was now standing a few feet from him on the blocky face above .	1
out of breath , out of strength and out of my mind , i jump backward and dropped to the snow slope next to isaac .	1
i collapsed in my tiny crater and rested .	1
duuude , watch out man , avalanche !	1
isaac hollered out .	1
moving on instinct alone , i rolled onto my stomach and dug my frozen hands into the deep snow as i planted my boots in below me .	1
i buried my face in the snow and waited .	1
the thick violent wave , rolled over the top of me as isaac stood firmly and held me with the rope .	1
i fought hard for my position , but was no match for the forces of nature .	1
with very little strength left , i was ripped from my position and dragged down-slope toward the edge of the cliff .	1
abruptly , my slide came to a stop as the snow fought to push me further .	1
i felt the wave of the avalanche dissipate and i looked up to investigate my predicament .	1
there , standing with teeth clenched , stood isaac .	1
with his arms outstretched , he hauled back on the rope and prevented my slide off the cliff .	1
you just going to lay there lollygagging all night ?	1
isaac shouted over the wind .	1
quickly , i jumped to my feet and plowed through the deep snow , ascending the short distance between us .	1
so , what do you think ?	1
wan na give it another shot ?	1
isaac asked , grinning ear to ear .	1
if i wasnt so tired , id kill you right now .	1
so what ?	1
now youre gon na wuss-out when were so close to the summit ?	1
isaac teased .	1
yes , i replied bluntly .	1
good call lets get the hell out of here , isaac responded in grave tone .	1
at that point , i was too tired to do anything but belay him back across the snow slope .	1
darkness had finally come and the snows were raging now , reducing the visibility to near whiteout conditions .	1
isaac ascended higher on the slope and waited for the next avalanche to pass through .	1
even before the rush had dissipated , he started off to the other side .	1
i paid out the rope through frozen finger as he plowed his way through the deep snow .	1
forty feet , thirty feet , isaac moved with determination .	1
he was nearly to the halfway mark , when i heard him scream over the wind .	1
hold me !	1
just then , isaac was caught in an avalanche .	1
the blizzards intensity had heightened , dumping even greater amounts of snow onto the upper regions above us .	1
the resultant snow created spindrift avalanched in greater quantity and ferocity .	1
isaac jumped to the ground and burrowed in as quickly as he could , but it was too late .	1
the wave of snow rolled into him , knocking him backward and dragging him down the mountain .	1
hold me , hold me !	1
i heard him scream out , now barely audible twenty feet from him .	1
i pulled hard and watched in desperation as he continued to slide toward the edge of the cliff .	1
as his slid , isaac rolled over onto his stomach and pounded his hands and feet into the snow , desperately trying to anchor himself to the slope .	1
downward he slipped : twenty feet , fifteen feet , ten feet toward the edge of the cliff .	1
his boots seemed mere feet from going over .	1
as the wave slowed , so did isaacs descent .	1
he jumped up and tried to swim higher up the slope .	1
seconds later , he jumped back down once more and buried his limbs into the snows around him .	1
i pulled hard on the rope , holding him against the inevitable .	1
like a malevolent entity , the snow raged over the top of him again , threatening him , punishing him for his presence on the mountain .	1
as isaac fought for his life , he began his downward slide toward the cliff .	1
fifteen feet , ten feet , five feet .	1
i watched in horror as his feet broke through the crust of snow that defined the cliffs edge .	1
isaacs feet were now dangling in air .	1
like a man swimming through mighty river rapids , isaac flailed his arms and nudged his knees higher .	1
then , as quickly as the avalanche struck , it was gone .	1
isaac leapt to his feet and lunged through the snows as he fought his way to the far side of the snow slope .	1
he was safe .	1
its a cake walk !	1
your turn dude !	1
isaac yelled from the other side .	1
the gods of nature smiled down upon me .	1
i timed the avalanches correctly and sprang across the snow-slope like a gazelle .	1
i remember the look of relief in isaacs eyes as i stepped beside him , barely making it past the next avalanche in series .	1
nice night for a walk , eh ?	1
he asked lovely , i replied in pleasant tone .	1
for the next five hours , isaac and i worked our way back across the mountain , then down the long and steep snow slope that lead to the valley floor .	1
fortunately for us , the blizzard slowed quite a bit and the spindrift avalanches all but disappeared .	1
by the time we got back to our camp , it was after midnight .	1
we had been climbing for almost 20 hours straight .	1
ive told this story before and usually receive the same reactions : head shakes and the standard verbal remonstrations , why would you do that ?	1
are you freakin crazy ?	1
well , all i have to say is that a crazy man wouldnt have dangled from a solitary ice axe , 1500 feet above the ground , petrified beyond comprehension .	1
nope , a crazy man would have let go .	1
im not crazy .	1
ps : years later , my friend isaac , tangled with another avalanche while climbing alone .	1
sadly , he never made it out alive .	1

-- - -- - -- - -- - -- - trae williams leaned to one side as he sat on his mothers decrepit front porch and watched his sister play in their front yard .	1
lena williams , an energetic eight-year-old , raced back and forth across the worn lawn as she chased after tiny moths that had hidden themselves on the blades of grass .	1
with each swipe of her hand , she expertly snatched the tiny white targets out of midair , then released them back to the world safely .	1
oh yeah !	1
trae , did you see that ?	1
lena asked proudly .	1
damn le , youre like a ninja or something , trae replied .	1
beaming with pride , lena replied , too bad mom cant see my skills .	1
shes working , le .	1
shell be home in a couple hours .	1
maybe you can show her then , trae answered .	1
moms always working , lena said disapprovingly , then added , too bad we dont have a dad like sharices , next door .	1
then mom could stay home too .	1
le , you do have a dad .	1
he just dont come around no more and sharices mom dont work cause shes lazy , trae replied as delicately as he knew how .	1
lena stopped running and sat down next to trae .	1
do you ever see your dad , trae ?	1
lena asked sincerely .	1
not for a long time .	1
not since before he went to prison .	1
that was before you were born , trae replied .	1
oh , lena said simply .	1
do you miss im ?	1
nah .	1
he wasnt around much , even before he got sent up , trae answered .	1
well , i miss my dad , lena replied .	1
damn , le , you never even seen im before .	1
how could you even miss im ?	1
trae blurted out in quick reaction .	1
i just do , traeim sure he misses me too , lena replied .	1
trae knew his sister was hurting from her fathers rejection .	1
hoping to take her mind off her pain , he searched for anything to distract her .	1
hey , le : check out those moths over by the street .	1
bet you cant catch em all , trae said , with a challenging smirk .	1
bet i can , lena replied , laughing .	1
immediately , lena sprang to her feet and darted to the edge of the road , both hands sweeping through the air as she lunged for more moths .	1
trae watched her for a moment , then became distracted as an older buick with faded paint slowly drifted toward the stop sign at the beginning of their street .	1
unremarkable at first , the long length of time spent at the stop sign made the old sedan a conspicuous sight .	1
trae focused more of his attention on the car .	1
something just wasnt right .	1
he squinted hard as he tried to see through the darkened , tinted windows , but it was of no use .	1
the occupants remained a mystery .	1
trae began to feel uneasy .	1
the old buick was literally parked at the stop sign for what now felt like an eternity .	1
he glanced over to lena , then back at the suspicious car .	1
a knot in the pit of his stomach began to grow .	1
le , come here for a minute , trae said in nervous tone .	1
just a minute , trae .	1
i almost caught em all , lena replied , indifferent to the world around her .	1
trae saw the brakes release from the old buick , then quickly stop again , almost as if by accident .	1
he looked up the street to see if the vehicle had intended on pulling out but reconsidered due to another passing car .	1
strangely , there were no other vehicles in sight .	1
lena , come here , trae said .	1
hearing trae use her full name , lena stopped and stared at her brother for a moment .	1
she could see the peculiar look spread across his face as he turned back toward the mysterious buick .	1
trae , whats the matter ?	1
lena asked innocently .	1
dunno .	1
that cars been there a while .	1
maybe you should go in the house for a minute , trae replied , now feeling the anxiety of the moment .	1
ahhh , lena sounded out in protest .	1
i dont want to go inside .	1
its just a car , trae .	1
besides , i can take care of myself , lena stated proudly .	1
uh huh , sure you can just get in the house , trae responded bluntly .	1
just one more m. lena began , but was cut short by the revving of the buicks engine .	1
lena , get in the damn house now !	1
trae shouted loudly .	1
suddenly , aggressively , the old buick released its brakes and stormed around the corner .	1
with tires squealing and smoke billowing from behind the car , the old sedan charged up the street toward them .	1
oh no , trae murmured to himself , almost in sobbing tone .	1
with little time to react , trae sprang to his feet and hurried toward his sister .	1
lena stood paralyzed in confusion .	1
she knew something was wrong , but was too young and naive to fully understand traes actions .	1
trae watched in horror as the buicks dark tinted windows began to lower .	1
in seconds , his worst fears were realized as the occupants extended their guns out from the windows .	1
with deafening sound , their automatic weapons came to life .	1
as bolts of white light streaked from the ends of the gun barrels , trae lunged for lena , knocking her to the ground .	1
he instinctively rolled on top of her to protect her as a hail of bullets tore up the ground around them .	1
as the faded buick roared past , trae and lena lay motionless on the front lawn , their minds and bodies unable to react .	1
as time seemed to slow , trae could almost count the bullets as they exited the guns .	1
one by one , each bullet miraculously missed it mark .	1
trae looked into his sisters eyes .	1
she had not been hit .	1
suddenly , he realized they both were alive and had made it through the drive-by shooting .	1
quickly , trae leapt to his feet , pulling lena up with him .	1
the sight of the two still alive spread quickly to the driver of the car .	1
in an instant , he slammed on his brakes and brought the old buick to a quick halt .	1
throwing it in reverse , he immediately roared backward down the street toward trae and lena .	1
seconds later , the driver slammed on the brakes once more and brought the heavy vehicle to a quick stop .	1
trae grabbed lena around the waist and sprang from the edge of the road .	1
like the stride of a gazelle , he bounded across the front lawn with amazing speed and agility , his adrenaline pumping at full capacity .	1
as the faded buick came to a stop , all its doors were flung open and four young men exited the vehicle quickly .	1
with their guns still drawn , they wasted no time in continuing their task .	1
trae leaped to the top step of his front porch and felt a sharp razor-like object strike his left side .	1
before the first bullet could even register , a second bullet struck him in the right shoulder , rendering his arm useless .	1
instantly , lena dropped onto the porch , trae collapsing beside her .	1
an eerie quiet spread over the neighborhood as the four thugs reloaded .	1
knowing this was their only hope of survival , trae crawled to the front door and tried to wrap his fingers around the lower corner .	1
with his hand covered in blood , they slipped off the edge of the door .	1
le , get in the house stay low , trae ordered .	1
lena , scared and crying , lay beside her brother , unable to move .	1
lena , get moving now !	1
trae shouted .	1
im scared , lena whimpered .	1
ill block you .	1
go now hurry up !	1
trae assured confidently .	1
nodding reluctantly , lena quickly stood up and pulled the front door open as trae moved to shield her from the four men nearby .	1
instantly , a roar of bullets unleashed a swath of destruction across the front of the house , breaking windows and knocking shingles from the siding .	1
as lena began to enter the house , another bullet entered traes lower back , knocking him forward against the door , closing it momentarily across lenas body .	1
trae rolled to his side and dropped down onto the deck of the porch once more .	1
trae !	1
lena cried out in fear and disbelief .	1
lena , get inside .	1
go , now !	1
trae said , his voice now barely audible .	1
no , i can help you , lena replied with determination .	1
before trae could protest , lena reached down and grabbed him by his shirt .	1
she pulled with all her might as trae pushed with his feet .	1
suddenly , lena exhaled abruptly and sounded a guttural moan , as a bullet struck her in the chest .	1
immediately , she slumped to the ground , then rolled over on top of trae .	1
with both victims down , the four thugs ran back to the waiting car and sped off .	1
once again , an eerie quiet swept over the neighborhood as the neighbors , one by one , ventured out into the warzone .	1
further south , along signal mountain , dr. phineas morgan stood on his wooden deck .	1
perched high above the valley floor , he stared out toward northern chattanooga and tried to shut out the images of carnage that had just taken place.from his location a few miles away , he could not see the muzzle flashes , nor did he hear the gunshots ; but strangely , he knew exactly where the shots were fired and who they were fired upon .	1
sadly , he checked his watch : 10:30am .	1
in a moment of solemn respect , he uttered a few simple words , forgive me lena .	1
your death will save thousands .	1
turning away , he stared out over the city and spoke .	1
the dominoes of destiny are now tumbling ... godspeed , david .	1
t t : chapter 2 chattanooga , tennessee , june 7 , 1862 8:30am the tennessee river quietly flowed south and west as it made its way past missionary ridge , toward the city of chattanooga .	1
the april rains were now a month past and the wild and raging torrent that threatened to breech the swollen banks was now a gentle lazy river that quietly meandered its way through the valley .	1
the muddy water that had angrily lapped the rivers banks receded some , leaving heavy , waterlogged brush and debris drying in the morning sunshine.soft and tranquil , the water trickled past the fallen branches that scraped the surface of the river , catching any unsuspecting object that dared to tempt its grasp .	1
flowing placidly south into the city , the river touched the edge of civilization , then abruptly changed course and headed north , past signal mountain .	1
several miles later , changing course once more , it looped around the mountain and continued its previous direction south , carrying with it the tiny bits and fragments of an industrialized city hard at work .	1
sitting patiently on an elevated boulder , a young boy hung his makeshift fishing pole over the water in an attempt to catch his breakfast .	1
looking toward the city , he could see the tall smoke stacks that emitted the evidence of men toiling at work .	1
a light , gentle breeze blew across the valley of high plains grasses , carrying with it the fragrance of fresh cut hay and wildflowers .	1
the breeze brushed past his face , filling his tiny nostrils with the scent of nature , and sending warm contentment throughout his body as the sun shined down upon him .	1
he reveled in his independence as he envisioned other boys suffering through school while he enjoyed his day of truancy .	1
further up river , leaving the city limits , a raft made from hastily hewn logs of birch were haphazardly strung together with cord and vine , creating an unstable , yet functional mode of travel .	1
dirty and bedraggled , the two aged trappers floated downstream , extending into the water , long poles made from pine saplings , skillfully placed to navigate the many bends in the river on the way to their next destination .	1
inside the city limits , at the sharpest bend in the river , a small force of confederates guarded the main dock and prepared to unload supplies .	1
in the morning sun , under the direction of the regimental captain , the men formed a human chain that led from boat to horse-drawn wagons .	1
hand over hand , they passed the goods and ammunition from one soldier to the next in sequence , until the final soldier arranged and stacked the supplies neatly in the back of the wagon .	1
at this hour of the day , the sun sat lower in the cloudless sky , warming the temperatures to a comfortable seventy degrees .	1
if it were not for their thankless duty to task , the soldiers would normally have enjoyed the balmy climate .	1
as it was , their heavy labor created torrents of salty sweat that streamed down their faces , and soaked through their cotton shirts and heavy gray uniforms .	1
when the wagon had been completely filled , the driver snapped the reins to the team of horses and started off to their encampment , whereupon the next driver in line took his place for loading .	1
beyond the dock , a local merchant swept off the elevated wooden walkway in front of his general store .	1
a small cloud of dust rose in the air as he briskly cleared away the caked mud that had collected between the wide spacing of the wooden boards that ran the length of the street .	1
at the rear entrance , a young man helped load heavy sacks and other supplies into a waiting wagon to be delivered to a local resident .	1
further up the boardwalk , the blacksmith and livery were hard at work , attending to the needs of the community as well as those of the confederate officers that had entrusted their belongings to their care .	1
at the center of the industrious town , off the open green , the one room schoolhouse bustled with activity and the sound of childrens voices , as they recited passages pulled from the important authors of the day , such as twain , thoreau , dickens and blake , each childs voice as distinctive as the passage they read .	1
beyond the main thoroughfare , on the secondary and tertiary roads , tiny houses dotted the roads leading out of town .	1
hung on public display , tiny diapers , socks , shirts , dresses and other freshly washed articles of clothing were draped over the makeshift clotheslines and pinned in place with wedges of wood , and allowed to dry in the brilliant sunshine as the matron of the home moved through her chores of the day .	1
this day began as any other day : monotonous and routine , men , women and children alike , functioning in their singular importance while contributing to the whole of their society .	1
unsuspecting and mostly indifferent to the violent world beyond their borders , they went about their lives , contented in their own daily struggles .	1
-- - -- - -- - -- - -- - on the opposite side of the river , hidden in the dense thicket and underbrush , several companies of union sharpshooters lay in wait .	1
quietly and undetected , they had moved to the rivers edge , sneaking in under the protection of darkness .	1
perfectly concealed , they laid on their stomachs and waited for their signal .	1
they watched in anxious fascination as the confederates on the opposite side of the river worked to unload their delivered supplies .	1
with their rifles aimed at their targets , they whiled away the time by calculating windage and elevation .	1
time seemed to slow as they waited on their signal of death .	1
at two hundred yards away , they were well aware of their ability to hit their mark .	1
spread out shoulder to shoulder , they presented a menacing sight .	1
the wait seemed to go on forever .	1
shifting their weight from side to side , they tried to alleviate their discomfort .	1
as their arms and legs fell asleep , they shook them out , recirculating the blood through their extremities , gaining the feeling in their hands and feet once again .	1
for an unlucky few , insects presented more of a distraction than the lack of feeling in their limbs .	1
with regularity , ants returning to their nest would find their passage blocked by the hulking mass in blue .	1
upon investigation , the ants angrily attacked any bare skin , biting and pinching in a futile attempt to drive away the enemy .	1
their feeble assault was met with equal aggression as the soldier swatted and crushed his irritating attackers .	1
time was their enemy .	1
waiting quietly in the underbrush , each soldier pondered his own fate .	1
any attempt to push the morbidity from their minds proved fruitless , as they watched the enemy in their sights , reminding them again of the possibility of their own forthcoming violent death .	1
searching for solace , they turned to their companions , whispering inquiries about families and future.in return , they received warm reassurance as the sound of their comrades whisper helped to sooth their deep worry .	1
having sat through the bite of cold as they crawled in under darkness , hunger pangs from lack of food , and the contemplation of death , the union volunteers of the 79th pennsylvania were ready and determined to complete their task .	1
up in the foothills , away from the edge of the river , the union artillery waited on their orders from gen. james negley .	1
high on his horse , barrel-chested and confident , he posed an impressive figure .	1
he sat pensively and observed the scene below .	1
lifting his spyglass to his eye , he continued to look for weakness and opportunity .	1
with an authoritative voice , he redirected cannons down the line to specific targets as he developed his impromptu battle plan .	1
as the union soldiers manned their stations of artillery , they looked out over the valley at the confederate soldiers drilling in formation in an open field far on the opposite side of the river .	1
several cannons were already directed toward them , but with a quick nod of his head , gen. negley ordered additional cannon support on that location .	1
feeling somewhat detached from the confederates impending doom , they obeyed their orders and indifferently aimed the deadly weapons at the center of the field .	1
standing by their designated cannon , each soldier mentally prepared himself for the battle .	1
at their elevated position , and protected by the river , they all felt relatively safe : that is , safer than their comrades below by the river .	1
they had survived the previous years battles , and were well seasoned in their trade .	1
they knew there would be casualties , but felt relatively sure that with the element of surprise , the battle would be fairly one-sided .	1
they looked down at their comrades who had crept up to the river 's edge just before dawn .	1
a sense of sadness and anxiety come over them , knowing they were in harms way .	1
any retaliation by rebel forces would start with them .	1
well-hidden in the thickets , the confederate soldiers would have a tough time distinguishing the exact locations of each union soldier .	1
the confederates would hear the sound of the union rifles and fire in that direction .	1
most of the boys in blue would be lucky , and escape the wild and harried volleys of lead .	1
some would not .	1
the previous day , june 6th , dr. jeb morgan prepared one of the supply wagons as a makeshift operating table in preparation for the impending battle .	1
as a commissioned medical officer in the regular union army , he held the rank of captain .	1
serving in the military for most of his life , he was no stranger to the horrors that warfare could bring .	1
his battlefield experience was extensive , having served in the mexican-american war of 1846-1848 , various indian campaigns , and now the war between the states .	1
dr. morgan was a short , stout , older man of sixty , with a full head of white hair , a long , white , flowing beard , and piercing blue eyes .	1
having dodged mexican bullets and fought hand to hand with indians , he possessed an inner strength and courage , as well as intelligence , that were uncommon for most , distinguishing himself for his skill with a firearm as well as a scalpel .	1
recognized for his abilities , he had been offered lofty positions at comfortable hospitals of his choosing , yet rejected the honor , preferring instead to remain in the field , saving a greater number of lives ; much to his superiors dismay .	1
far behind the union front line , the doctor had searched for a suitable location to operate .	1
in a protected grove of birch trees , he found a large flat area with lush green grass .	1
as the principal surgeon for the brigade , it was his job to ensure a site that was far enough from the action to allow for undistracted work , yet close enough to the front lines for quick evacuation and treatment .	1
ordinarily , dr. morgan preferred the protected confines of houses and barns , commandeered from private citizens at the onset of battle .	1
with the battle for chattanooga started from a location far removed from civilization in order to preserve the element of surprise , the wooded clearing would have to suffice .	1
the previous day , while gen. negley prepared his battle plan , dr. morgan scoured the foothills near signal mountain on horseback .	1
as he rode up through the rolling terrain , the trees and vegetation became less dense , allowing him to catch glimpses of the city .	1
leveling off , he rode through the forest of white birch , weaving a path around the denser areas until he found the clearing.immediately , he recognized the qualities of the find .	1
he deduced the small field would allow for bright light to operate by , and the trees at the clearings edge would provide comfortable shade to the wounded as they recovered .	1
it wasnt perfect , but he felt he had worked in worse conditions while fighting in the west .	1
this would certainly be more tolerable as long as the good weather held .	1
after locating the medical encampment , dr. morgan quickly summoned a wagon to be used as an operating gurney and prepared his instruments .	1
with the canopy removed , he neatly arranged his supplies on the right side , along the length of the wooden side-bracing .	1
within arms reach , he placed his instruments first ; a basin and canteen of water next ; then cotton batting and other bandages last .	1
at the head of the wagon , he arranged the necessary supplies for the assistant , such as chloroform , bandages , and morphine in powder form , as well as opium as an analgesic .	1
with the preparation for surgeries in place , he rejoined the front lines , offering his assistance where he could , leaving an assistant to watch over their makeshift hospital in his absence .	1
the following day , june seventh the day of the battle dr. morgan woke early after a restful night 's sleep under one of the many cannons aimed at the city .	1
he was offered a tent for accommodation , but declined special privilege , electing to rough it under a cannon instead of putting others out .	1
a selfless man , he figured the boys that were fighting and dying should at least be granted the small pleasure of the comfort of a tent .	1
after years of adapting to the rigors of warfare , he learned to sleep wherever he laid his head .	1
the dawn of the new morning created cool dew that had soaked through the unprotected parts of his body , mainly his legs and boots , producing mild discomfort .	1
by 8:30am , his clothing had dried out completely and he focused on his duties of the day .	1
filling up on hardtack , a hard , flavorless cracker , and some water , he administered various remedies to the soldiers that had reported for sick call while he ate .	1
of the thirteen men reporting various symptoms , only one was deemed incapacitated.suffering from acute dysentery , he was given a mixture of quinine and dover 's powder , and sent to the medical encampment for recovery .	1
dr. morgan was a compassionate and sympathetic older man , but tough nonetheless .	1
his private philosophy was , `` if you can walk , you can fight . ''	1
with his duties accomplished for the moment , gen. negley ordered dr. morgan to his station with a reverent nod .	1
no words were exchanged .	1
they both were seasoned military men who understood each other implicitly .	1
with a respectful salute , the doctor turned and walked past the soldiers readying themselves at their own stations .	1
he could now see the woeful anxiety on their faces as he made his way past , and he flashed them a courteous smile , trying to ease their worry .	1
locating his horse , a dark brown canadian stallion called bill , named for an old friend that had died at the hands of an indian ambush years before , he mounted the saddle , adjusted his boots in the stirrups , and with a quick snap of the reins , turned and rode off toward safety .	1
-- - -- - -- - -- - -- - fire !	1
with his sword lifted to an exalted position above his head , gen. negley roared the order to commence firing .	1
loud and with great authority , he repeated his simple command over and over as he rode up the line .	1
instantly , his men responded and lit the fuses to their cannons .	1
like violent demons , the cannons came to life as they reported with a thunderous roar , shaking the ground under them .	1
instantly , the fresh and clear morning air became a heavy cloud of smoke that stung their eyes and seared their nostrils with the foul stench of sulfur , as the powder quickly burned and discharged through the breech of the cannon.the deafening cacophony of cannon and soldier startled the birds and jarred other wildlife from their morning routine , instinctively sending them scrambling for cover .	1
the well-trained soldiers began their work .	1
in groups of three , one loaded the powder and wadding , one loaded the shell or heavy ball , and the third lit the charge .	1
they were as a machine , working in perfect sequence and timing to efficiently deliver unto the enemy , their deadly payload .	1
whistling through the air , the shells and cannonballs picked up particulates of dust and small flying insects as they arced across the valley toward chattanooga , killing anything in their path before reaching their final destination .	1
the valley below became awake .	1
the loud cannon fire from above signaled the sharpshooters below to unleash their own deadly volley of destruction .	1
in reflex , they pulled their triggers and sent the tiny , yet deadly pieces of lead on their individual paths of doom , as they quickly reloaded their weapons with practiced speed .	1
they had only a second to think .	1
with a startled jolt , the town and the confederate soldiers both stood in place as their minds tried to quickly process the disbelief of their forthcoming death .	1
unable to move , they heard the whistle of air as the projectiles hurled toward them .	1
those with their backs to the volley waited and listened as the whistle grew quickly louder , into a thunderous rush of air .	1
those facing the volley watched in disbelief as they quickly trained their eyes on the direction of sound , watching the heavy ball and tiny bullets disrupt the air in front of them just before impact .	1
as fate and misfortune collided , so did shell and flesh .	1
in the group of drilling confederate soldiers , the first volley hit its mark with deadly accuracy .	1
one unlucky private watched in horror as a shell found its mark in the chest of the unlucky companion marching in front of him .	1
the shell tore through his uniform , flesh and ribcage , instantly killing him even before the shell 's internal mechanisms sensed the pressure of impact .	1
with a great explosion , the canister fragmented into thousands of tiny projectiles , completely disintegrating the whole of the soldiers existence .	1
there would be no burial for him , as there was not a remnant left of his body .	1
continuing on their way , the fragments of the now exploded shell found their next victim in the watching soldier .	1
as the hot pieces of metal tore through his body , it severed his extremities , as well as buried molten metal into his own chest .	1
deflected , yet still deadly , the fragments found other victims all around the location of impact , sending blood , torn limbs and other shredded body parts into their fellow soldiers .	1
for a lucky few who escaped the initial impact , the concussion from the shockwave of the explosion ruptured their eardrums , disorienting them and rendering them useless .	1
as other shells exploded into and around the stunned , helpless soldiers , the same gory results affected the devastating loss of the entire company .	1
along the waterfront , the confederate soldiers that were unloading supplies met with the same fate as their drilling comrades .	1
shells fell around them , exploding into thousands of fragments and tearing through their bodies , killing the closest to impact while maiming and impairing others further away from the epicenter .	1
cries of agony could be heard as they fell .	1
as the union sharpshooters unleashed their hail of shot , balls of lead sailed through the air with an awful shrill , telegraphing their intentions .	1
the bullets found their mark , tearing through gray cloth , violently ripping through flesh and bone , and creating large , gaping wounds for germs and disease to enter the body unrestricted .	1
collapsing to the ground , many screamed out in agony , clutching their bleeding wounds in a desperate attempt to relieve the pain as death quickly overcame them .	1
others lay in torment as hypovolemic shock quickly enveloped their bodies from the loss of blood .	1
all around the city , that first barrage of munitions inflicted devastating damage .	1
not only was the confederate encampment targeted : loading docks on the river , telegraph offices , livery stables and blacksmith shops were also targeted .	1
anything that could be used to further the confederates cause was targeted in the first volley of union fire .	1
within seconds of the first discharge from the union rifles and cannons , another round quickly sounded , followed by a third and fourth volley .	1
the murderous fire seemed unrepulsed at first , but slowly , the confederate soldiers that had not been wounded , and others that had not been targeted withdrew and regrouped to form a defensive line at various points around the city .	1
with determined anger , positioned behind a breastwork of wagons and supplies , a band of confederates located both sources of gunfire coming from the opposite side of the river and higher up in the foothills , and unleashed their first of many volleys of retaliation and repel .	1
as union soldiers lay on their stomachs and reloaded , they heard the sound of lead crashing through the branches and thickets above them as the confederates searched for their targets by trial and error .	1
with the next round by the union sharpshooters , more confederates lay dead and wounded , but with this volley came a pinpointing of the unions exact positions .	1
with orders to aim low , the confederates returned fire into the lower banks of the river .	1
cries of pain and agony testified to the confederates skill , as several union soldiers now lay dead and permanently maimed , slowly reducing their effective force .	1
just as with the confederates , the union soldiers now were on the defensive , and scrambled for a moment , regrouping into a smaller fighting force .	1
unbeknownst to the union command , out beyond the city limits , the confederates loaded several cannons .	1
tucked away in a grove of tall oaks for protection from the elements , they were easily missed by their opposing force .	1
quickly , the three-man teams loaded their cannons and took careful aim at the union battery .	1
with the command to fire at will , the confederates opened up on the union forces staged in the foothills of signal mountain .	1
with visibility drastically reduced by the repeated cannon fire , the union forces struggled to see targets .	1
by the time the union artillery brigade saw the heavy smoke from the confederate volley , it was too late .	1
as the scream of the fragmentation canisters telegraphed their arrival , the union soldiers could only stand and watch in horror as the tiny projectiles grew larger in their vision , the speed leaving them little else to do but stand and watch their impending death .	1
the first of the four canisters roared into camp and impacted the ground between two cannon batteries , immediately exploding into tiny shards of twisted and molten metal .	1
instantly , the thousands of fragments traveled from the point of impact and found the first of their victims in the two union soldiers that stood between the two cannons .	1
within a blink of an eye , their bodies absorbed most of the fragments , nearly obliterating any proof of their existence .	1
blood and bone splattered the two cannons in a characteristically horrific pattern of death and destruction .	1
as the fragments deflected and ricocheted off objects human and metallic , their destruction was devastating , in all , killing and maiming nine union soldiers .	1
a split second later , two more canisters roared in after the first , these two impacting the bluff just below the union 's cannoning .	1
although the projectiles embedded in the earth and exploded , their destructive intention would not be denied .	1
the soil heaved and broke apart , sending large amounts of fast-moving granules of dirt and pebbles toward the union battery , ripping into flesh , maiming several union men hard at work , the force knocking them to the ground in agonizing pain .	1
the last canister rocketed over the heads of the union soldiers and hit a birch tree high up in its trunk , exploding and instantly amputating its upper half from the lower .	1
the crash of the tree as it hit the ground went unnoticed as the union forces turned their destructive force onto the cloud of confederate smoke far out beyond chattanooga .	1
with a wave of his sword , gen. negley bellowed the order to silence the cannons at the far edge of town .	1
quickly , the teams of three jockeyed their cannons toward the fading confederate smoke , calculated the angle of trajectory , and lit their charges .	1
the repositioned cannons came to life as their muzzles spewed fire , smoke , and metallic death , the recoil sending them reeling backward against their restraints .	1
seconds later , far out beyond the city proper , primary explosions could be seen as the shells hit their targets , followed by several secondary explosions , signaling the destruction of enemy ammo caches that had ignited as a result of the primary detonation .	1
violently jolted from his lazy stare up river , the young boy sitting on the elevated boulder fishing for his breakfast nearly fell into the water in reflex to the loud explosions .	1
he quickly gathered his things and jumped from rock to rock , desperately fleeing for cover .	1
still at the bank of the river , he found two large boulders to hide behind , giving him safe cover during the violent exchange .	1
closer to the action , the two bedraggled trappers , upon hearing the deafening explosions that were killing their countrymen , quickly deduced that their only safe escape was to continue their poling down river .	1
any attempt to make land might expose them as combatants and draw fire from either side .	1
they grabbed their poles even harder and strained to push the tiny raft faster down river .	1
hand over hand , they pushed on the flimsy poles , nearly breaking them as they rushed to evade harms way .	1
painful blisters formed and quickly broke , leaving fresh blood along the length of the poles as they continued to push for their lives .	1
standing on the left side of the raft , without warning , a single stray bullet whistled through the air and impacted the back of the first trappers head .	1
the lead ball mushroomed and shattered his skull , propelling bone , brain and blood down the front of his tattered clothes and into the river .	1
instantly , he fell overboard and floated downstream .	1
in shock from witnessing the death of his companion , the remaining trapper cried out in anguish as he helplessly watched his friend floating away , trailing behind him a path of red water .	1
reality snapped him back into focus as another bullet embedded into one of the logs of the raft , fracturing it and sending tiny splinters into the water .	1
he looked back at the pelts of beaver and muskrat he and his now deceased friend had toiled over for the previous two months .	1
he hesitated for a moment , then grabbed a handful of beaver pelts , his rifle , and a tiny strongbox of money , then quickly jumped into the water .	1
struggling to stay afloat with the weight of the rifle , he kicked his boots wildly under the water .	1
as his head dipped below the surface , he was about to let go of the rifle when his feet touched bottom .	1
he pushed off the muddy floor of the river and popped his head above the water , took a gasp of air and sunk below the water again .	1
finding the bottom of the river once more , he launched his waterlogged body above the surface and gasped for another breath of air .	1
as he sank back into the water , his head now was above the water line .	1
he had managed to move close enough to shore to now wade toward land with his handful of belongings safe .	1
spotting a large boulder at the rivers edge , he made his way toward it , keeping his head mostly submerged for cover .	1
at the boulder , he threw his pelts and strongbox onto higher ground and positioned his rifle for defense .	1
with the powder wet and useless , he still aimed his weapon , hoping he would not be called on to bluff .	1
shaking and scared , the young boy huddled close to the rock , having just witnessed the drama of the trappers unfold further upriver .	1
at the tender age of seven , he had never seen a man killed before , and the sight of the old trapper 's violent death shook him to his core .	1
his world had changed in an instant , the graphic vision imprinted in his memory forever .	1
he openly wept as he watched the remains of the old man drift slowly downstream past him .	1
union corporal amol fletcher , part of a three-man team assigned to artillery , had been standing at his post when the first of the four confederate shells exploded .	1
fighting two cannons away , the blast sent shrapnel through his team , decapitating one private and missing the other , while he himself took a large fragment to his lower leg , nearly severing his calf from the bone .	1
instantly , he dropped to the ground in agony .	1
as he cried out in pain , he clutched the dangling flesh , irrationally trying to reattach it to the bone .	1
in his delirium , his world seemed to slow .	1
no one noticed him as he lay sprawled on the ground between the cannons .	1
as bullets passed over his head , he heard their whistle , and for a moment forgot about his injury as a sense of self-preservation overtook him .	1
he rolled on his belly and began to crawl .	1
pulling with his arms and pushing with his uninjured leg , he slowly worked his way through cannon and soldier , dragging a trail of blood behind him .	1
as hypovolemic shock began to develop from the loss of blood , the pain from his gaping wound became less noticeable .	1
he moved faster and with more determination .	1
suddenly , a soldier lay in his path , face down .	1
corporal fletcher grabbed his shoulder to roll him over as he felt the sting of hot lead graze his forearm and impact the back of the soldiers head .	1
instantly , the soldiers skull exploded , covering corporal fletcher 's face with blood , bits of brain and bone .	1
he jerked away in reflex and cried out in fear , only to feel the mind-numbing pain of his own injury .	1
as fear enveloped him further , he quickly crawled around the deceased soldier and continued on his path .	1
up ahead , several yards away , he spotted a boulder for protection .	1
fear and anxiety coursed through his veins as he struggled to stay alive .	1
desperately , deliberately , he stretched his hands out in front of him , clawing at anything he could use to further his escape .	1
as he crawled , the elevation dropped off slightly , allowing him more protection from the bullets passing above .	1
with grass and mud embedded in his fingernails , he reached the larger boulder and pulled himself around it to safety lying on his stomach , he rolled over and sat up against the smooth granite rock .	1
he heard the sound of bullets ricocheting off the boulder and deflecting into the trees around him as he instinctively ducked from the sound .	1
with his adrenaline pumping , he reached down to his grass- and dirt-stained shirt and ripped off a strip from its bottom edge .	1
taking the strip in both hands , he lifted the hanging flesh and secured it to the bone with the cloth , tying a loose knot to hold his calf in place as the pain caused him to scream in reflex .	1
a short distance away , a private pulling a horse-drawn ambulance heard the painful shriek of corporal fletcher over the thunder of war .	1
this was his first pass through as he searched for casualties .	1
hearing the horrific screams , he snapped the reins to the team of horses and quickly located the suffering corporal , barely conscious but still feeling his agony .	1
he leaped down from the buckboard and ran to his side with a canteen of cool water .	1
kneeling , he placed the canteen to the corporal 's lips and slowly poured a few swallows into his mouth .	1
corporal fletcher , in his grave state , choked and coughed as the water entered his mouth , causing him to cry out in pain once more .	1
instinctively he pushed the privates hand away and opened his eyes .	1
in a weakened voice , he said , they 've killed me .	1
the rebs have killed me .	1
looking down at corporal fletcher 's blood , which had pooled under his leg , the private quickly realized the gravity of the situation .	1
as he reached to lift the fading corporal , he replied , nonsense .	1
doc morgan will have that leg off in no time .	1
you 'll be good as new in a just a few days .	1
he smiled as he spoke , hoping to lift the corporal 's spirits .	1
even in the corporal 's deteriorated state , he knew the grisly torture that awaited him once back at the makeshift hospital .	1
he stiffened a moment and looked down at his maimed appendage .	1
he envisioned the painful procedure , then the disfigured remnant that would be left as a sad reminder of the reality of war .	1
disheartened , he slumped into the arms of the private , who struggled to lift him into the waiting ambulance .	1
moments later , laying in one of the hard , wooden gurneys , he was reminded of his agony as the private snapped the reins , abruptly jarring the wagon , sending excruciating pain through his gaping wound and up his spine .	1
sorry , the private responded sincerely , although there was little he could do to improve the comfort of the wounded .	1
moments later , through his own screams of agony , he heard the cries of another wounded soldier being loaded into the wooden ambulance .	1
he glanced over to see a young boy of sixteen , thin , with wavy yellow hair , being roughly hauled into the gurney on the opposite side of the wagon .	1
with the ghastly wound in his stomach , he did n't have long to live .	1
his blues eyes were sunken and dulled from the loss of blood , a good deal of which completely saturated his shirt and pants , as well as his hands , as he had tried in relieve the pain with pressure to his wound .	1
lying there in his agony , he cried out to god to end his suffering .	1
corporal fletcher could almost feel the young boy 's despair as he irrationally waited in vain for a higher power to answer his dying prayer .	1
with the realization that he was all alone , he retreated into the far recesses of his mind , his last haven for solace .	1
rolling his head from side to side , he murmured under his breath , `` mama , mama . ''	1
at the end of his consciousness , unable to speak , corporal fletcher mustered the last bit of his strength as he stretched out a weak , shaking hand , and gently laid it upon the privates shoulder .	1
the young privates eyes widened a moment as he quietly spoke in a receiving tone , `` mama .	1
i love you . ''	1
as the corporals world went black , he slipped into unconsciousness , having brought some measure of relief to the poor dying boy beside him .	1
it was all he could do , and it was enough .	1
shortly after losing consciousness , the young boy quietly died beside him , passing beyond the horrific end into peace .	1
-- - -- - -- - -- - -- - dr. jeb morgan paced back and forth by the operating wagon , envisioning the dead and wounded with each report of the union cannons .	1
with each crack of a twig or an unusual sound of the wind , he craned his head to listen more intently , hoping for any advanced warning of the ambulances delivering their wounded .	1
the minutes felt like hours as he reached into his pants pocket and pulled out his elgin pocket watch .	1
he pressed the tiny button of the gold timepiece and popped the cover , exposing the hands of time .	1
huh , only 10:30 , he said aloud , frustrated at how slow time felt during moments of anguish .	1
he snapped the cover closed and shoved the watch back into his pants pocket once more .	1
returned to his pacing , he gazed through the grove of birch trees , trying to view the battle at his protected location .	1
barely visible , columns of smoke and debris could be seen rising off the valley floor .	1
the sight made him wonder how the confederates were faring , and if their own surgeon was also nervously pacing .	1
it started as a low clicking sound , barely audible .	1
at first dr. morgan thought it might be cannon echoes reverberating off the mountains , but as the sound persisted , he recognized the distinctive repetitive sound .	1
it was the hooves from a team of horses as they trotted .	1
he strained his eyes in the direction of the sound , but still saw nothing .	1
he spun on his heels and ran toward the operating wagon .	1
ok , men ; were on , dr. morgan called out in a deep authoritative voice .	1
fetch my smock , he ordered a nearby private , who was sitting on the ground , sunning himself .	1
yes sir , the private quickly responded , hopping to his feet .	1
moments later , the screams of pain could be heard as the driver hauled the wounded over rocks , logs and uneven ground as he made his way through the birch forest to the makeshift medical camp .	1
he pulled into the clearing and rolled to the waiting operating wagon .	1
standing in their clean white smocks stood dr. morgan , assistant surgeon george fowler , pvt .	1
douglas , who had been resting earlier , and pvt .	1
cleveland .	1
the horses came to a halt with the rear of the ambulance just past the operating wagon .	1
immediately , dr. morgan ran to the wounded and began his assessment .	1
there were three soldiers lying with their feet toward him .	1
he quickly saw corporal fletcher 's leg and the pool of blood that had collected under it .	1
as he climbed up into the ambulance , the private driving the wagon met him in the middle .	1
pointing to the young boy of sixteen , he shook his head sadly and moved his gaze to the private laying at the bottom of the wagon between the two gurneys .	1
the young private was still conscious and suffering terribly due to a bullet that had penetrated his leg just below the knee and smashed through the bone , leaving a gaping wound and shattered fragments embedded into the raw , mangled flesh .	1
assessing the situation , dr. morgan quickly pronounced the young boy dead , and turned his attention to the two men still living .	1
feeling corp. fletcher had the gravest injury , he motioned to the two privates to carry him to the operating table .	1
immediately , the two lifted the gurney out of the ambulance and over to the other wagon .	1
as dr. morgan cut away a portion of the corporals pant leg , asst .	1
george fowler prepared the chloroform .	1
dr. morgan looked up while cutting and said , abruptly , save it .	1
he 's unconscious .	1
i 'll have his leg off well before he ever wakes up .	1
asst .	1
fowler stowed the chloroform and replied , you think he 'll ever regain consciousness after this ?	1
i do .	1
dr. morgan replied simply , then added , once i tie off those arteries , i think he 'll be ok ; that is , if we can control the infection .	1
asst .	1
sgt .	1
fowler just nodded as he jumped down off the wagon and came around to the back .	1
he stood for a moment and awaited further orders .	1
looking at the gruesome sight , asst .	1
fowler watched as dr. morgan placed the mechanical tourniquet just above the knee and over the femoral artery .	1
with the strap wrapping around the leg , he pulled hard to tighten the cloth band around the skin .	1
he then turned a large lever on the tourniquet to take in the excess slack .	1
moments later , the blood that oozed from the wound slowed to a slight trickle .	1
dr. morgan 's hands were already covered in blood as he reached for his scalpel .	1
with his pant leg gone , corporal fletcher 's right leg was fully exposed .	1
starting at the top surface of the leg , dr. morgan began the amputation as he explained the procedure to asst .	1
fowler while he operated .	1
right , i know this is your first time , so i 'll try to explain as much as practicable .	1
first we determine the point of incision closest to the wound .	1
we always try to leave as much of the amputating limb as possible .	1
i 'd say we could safely amputate about an inch or so behind the wound , dr. morgan said as he placed the scalpel on the top of the leg .	1
looking up at his assistant , then up to corp. fletcher to ensure he was unconscious , he was now ready .	1
right then .	1
start at the top , here , he said , pointing with the scalpel .	1
we pierce through the upper integuments skin , that is cutting through the fascia and just into the muscle .	1
this really should be quite simple with him unconscious .	1
as he explained , he pierced through both layers of skin and into the muscle as he sliced from the top and worked his way around to the bottom , blood and fatty yellow tissue immediately oozing from the laceration .	1
at the bottom , he reached around the leg , coming up from underneath on the opposite side and continued to make his incision up the other side , ending at his first point of incision .	1
the two incisions were so quick , asst .	1
fowler barely had time to comprehend .	1
ok , i need you to pull back the first layer as i cut down to the bone .	1
just be careful of your fingers though .	1
i 'm moving pretty fast here and we do n't want an accidental amputation of any of your digits , ok ?	1
dr. morgan asked .	1
asst .	1
fowler nervously nodded his head and placed his unwashed fingers into the incision and began to pull back on the skin , opening it wider for dr. morgan .	1
as he did this , he asked a question .	1
sir , why do n't we cut right down to the bone on the first pass ?	1
would n't it be faster ?	1
looking up at his assistant , dr. morgan replied , good question , lad .	1
we could do this in one pass , but we lose the precision as we slice deep into the muscle .	1
the remaining stump usually ends up grossly disfigured , more so than is acceptable , frequently leaving the appendage quite painful for use .	1
the accepted practice is the double incision , as we are doing now .	1
we will produce a stump that will retain more muscle tissue covering the bone , making it a less painful , as well as a more useful appendage .	1
asst .	1
fowler nodded , then turned his attention to his fingers as he pulled the incision open .	1
dr. morgan reached for a longer bladed scalpel .	1
he inserted it into the bloody tissue at the top , then angled the blade so that he would be cutting several inches up and underneath his assistants hand , effectively cutting out a cone shaped piece of muscle down to the bone .	1
the first pass , the doctor sliced deeply into the flesh , slicing though vein , muscle and tendons , hitting the bone and increasing blood flow onto the table .	1
as he was instructed , asst .	1
fowler pulled back the freshly sliced muscle as the doctor worked quickly .	1
reaching over the leg once more , the doctor continued his conical-shaped incision from the bottom and worked his way to the top .	1
with his hands saturated in blood , he reached for a long strip of cloth a few inches wide .	1
he worked around the bone , then pulled up on each end of the strip , lightly suspending the leg for a moment .	1
he then pulled the cloth up the leg , which pulled the muscles higher up the bone .	1
ok , we 've pulled the muscles higher up the bone .	1
i 'll cut through the bone as close to the cloth as i can without cutting through it the cloth , that is .	1
when we release the cloth , the muscle will spring back to its original position , covering the bone by a couple of inches , allowing for greater cushioning after healing , dr. morgan elaborated .	1
he reached for his saw and placed his thumb on the bone as a guide .	1
resting the saw against his thumb , he pulled two times toward himself , leaving a small pilot slot to start the cut .	1
he then began to aggressively saw through the bone .	1
in seconds , he was nearly through the bone , as he began to slow .	1
at the end , he only pulled the saw toward himself , insuring that the bone would not splinter .	1
with the last pull of the saw , the lower leg completely detached from the upper leg .	1
at the end of the table , the top-heavy foot rolled to one side under its own weight , and fell from the table into the grass below .	1
the blood pooled around the end of the stump as the assistant released the cloth holding the muscle .	1
quickly reaching for a pre-threaded needle , the doctor began to tie off the various blood vessels , starting with the femoral artery .	1
right then .	1
see those strands that look like tiny pieces of twine ?	1
they are the various blood vessels that supplied the lower leg with blood .	1
those all need to be tied off or he 'll bleed to death , the doctor said as he worked .	1
with the bleeding completely stopped , he slowly released the tourniquet and watched for leakages at the end of the stump .	1
seeing none , he then began to sew up the exposed wound .	1
he quickly pulled the extra skin over the muscle and began to stitch across them .	1
the ligatures should not be too close , as there needs to be room for drainage of any excess blood and pus while the appendage heals , the doctor said as he stitched , his assistant looking on in fascination .	1
when he was done suturing , he allowed asst .	1
fowler to bandage the end while he rinsed off his tools and threw the bloody foot into a basket to be carried away later .	1
turning to his assistance , he said dryly , let 's hope there wo n't be too many of these today .	1
asst .	1
fowler just nodded .	1
the whole bloody experience was almost too graphic for him as he tried to process the procedure in his mind .	1
right , let 's have a look at the other fellow , shall we ?	1
the doctor asked rhetorically .	1
bandaging the corporals amputated leg , he looked up to see that dr. morgan was already cutting away the other soldiers pant leg , presaging the next operative process .	1
moments later , the sound of distant gallops could be heard as more teams of horses began to arrive , pulling their wooden ambulances as they rushed the wounded to safety .	1
faster than they could operate , the privates carried more wounded union soldiers to the operating wagon .	1
the basket of amputated limbs mounded over as the doctor disposed of the useless appendages , throwing them unceremoniously onto the bloody pile of flesh and bone that had already began to rot in the heat of the day .	1
as each mangled limb landed on the bloody mound , swarms of flies darted away , escaping the falling limb , then quickly returned and continued their forage of filth and disease on their newly found real estate .	1
as the wounded flowed in , they were helped to the shady edges of the grassy clearing to wait their turn under the knife.disheartening moans of agony could be heard everywhere as the injured men left one horrific world and entered another .	1
working quickly to overcome the numbers , dr. morgan set up another operating wagon for asst .	1
fowler .	1
working side by side , dr. morgan monitored his assistants work .	1
at first , the doctor assigned simple amputations to dr. fowler , but as the number of wounded mounted and dr. fowler began to grow into his newly acquired skills , dr. morgan allowed him to take on more complex surgeries .	1
with two doctors working , the basket used to dispose of the limbs had long since disappeared under the carnage .	1
the stench of iron hung heavy in the air from the blood that spewed from the wounded .	1
through blank and pallor faces , some stared out into nothingness as shock deadened reality .	1
others winced and grimaced with each breath they took , and still others cried out in agony , each time dying a thousand deaths .	1
hearing the suffering of their countrymen only served to stiffen both doctors resolve to save more men .	1
throughout the day and into the night , the two surgeons worked frantically to save the injured and the dying .	1
as their exhaustion set in , and hysteria and despair overwhelmed them , they searched within themselves for the strength to continue .	1
eventually , their own bodies and minds began to fail them .	1
they had pushed themselves to the limits of human endurance .	1
with the battle not yet complete , they both knew that tomorrow would bring further death and pain .	1
if they were going to be of service to the young men risking their lives for their country , they both would need some much deserved rest .	1
with the last flicker of light from the nearly spent oil lamps , the blood soaked surgeons made their way across the other side of the clearing to their two canvas tents .	1
with a quick change of clothing , they laid down on their cots and fell quickly asleep .	1
tt : chapter 3 june 8th , 2005 elanger hospital was a bustling modern hospital with four branches spread out on each side of the city of chattanooga ; north , south , east , west , and one at the center of the city , accounting for five in total .	1
regarded as a teaching hospital , they developed and performed the latest cutting-edge medical techniques , producing some of the finest medical staff in the country ; although all too often the advancements came as a result of the gang-related violence that erupted within the inner city , many times catching the innocent in its crossfire .	1
dr. david warner burst through the swinging wooden double-doors and headed to the scrub station .	1
`` ok , what do we have ? ''	1
he asked as he turned on the water and pulled on the soap dispenser , releasing a large dollop into his hands .	1
vigorously he scrubbed from his fingertips to his elbows as he listened to his supporting staff inform him of the emergency .	1
`` doctor , we have a gunshot victim with an entry and exit wound between the seventh and eighth rib , entry through the abdomen .	1
her belly 's distended , must be filling up with blood .	1
her vitals are low , about eighty-five over sixty .	1
her foley output is bright red and shes hypovolemic from the blood loss .	1
triage has intubated her and already infused 2 liters of plasma , '' replied surgical resident kerry stadler , as he too scrubbed in for emergency surgery .	1
`` so she 's prepped ? ''	1
dr. warner asked .	1
`` yes , doctor .	1
prepped and ready , '' dr stadler replied .	1
`` films ? ''	1
dr. warner asked in abbreviated speech , a function of his occupation .	1
before he could receive an answer , surgical nurse jill edwards burst through the door .	1
pulling her mask from her face , she anxiously reported , `` doctors , you 'd better hurry .	1
her vitals are dropping fast .	1
bp is eighty over fifty-five , pulse ox is eighty-five . ''	1
without hesitation , dr. warner quickly responded , `` gloves and gown , now !	1
and set up a thoracotomy tray , along with a laporatomy just in case . ''	1
both doctors washed the soap from their hands and arms quickly as the pressure and anxiety of the situation worsened .	1
should we get an ultrasound in here ?	1
dr. stadler asked as he started to tie his gown .	1
yes , stat !	1
dr. warner replied urgently .	1
as the two doctors quickly donned their attire , nurse edwards pulled on her protective mask and rushed back into the or to prep the ultrasound equipment and set up the thoracotomy tray .	1
moving through the double doors , dr warner heard the sounds of alarms as the medical equipment coldly reported a patient in crisis .	1
he scanned the various devices as the patients levels continued to drop into the danger zone .	1
as he rushed to the patients side , dr. warner 's eyes widen in disbelief as he realized the age of the tiny victim .	1
`` my god , shes just a baby .	1
how old is she ? ''	1
`` eight years , '' nurse edwards replied , her voice sadly exposing what her mask disguised .	1
whats her name ?	1
dr. warner asked .	1
the chart says lena williams , nurse edwards replied .	1
shaking his head in disgust , he listened as the cardiac monitor sounded slower beats and become erratic .	1
immediately , he reacted out of instinct .	1
she needs volume now .	1
hang another two on the rapid infuser , he said , his voice showing the strain as the youth of his patient weighed heavy in his mind .	1
bp 's seventy over fifty and dropping , pulse ox is eighty-two , dr. stadler informed his mentor and colleague .	1
i just lost her pulse , nurse edwards cried out as the cardiac monitor sounded the unmistakable tone of flat line .	1
push an amp of atropine .	1
charge the paddles to fifty , dr. warner retorted back .	1
nurse edwards quickly wheeled over the defibrillator and programmed the setting to pediatric , while charging the external paddles to fifty joules .	1
she quickly handed them to dr. warner , then injected an amp of atropine into the patients iv .	1
as dr. warner prepared paddles , dr. stadler scanned the young patients belly with ultrasound .	1
rotating the small metallic wand at various angles , images showed on the monitor , confirming their suspicions of the hidden trauma .	1
having applied conductive gel , dr. warner placed one of the paddles to the upper right clavicle , and one just below and to the left of the young patients left nipple .	1
clear , dr. warner called out .	1
dr. stadler broke off his examination just as dr warner depressed the buttons on the paddles , delivering a charge to the heart as well as other nearby organs .	1
the patients body convulsed from the current coursing through her .	1
her chest heaved and expanded , then fell and contracted back onto the table .	1
the three medical personnel focused on the cardiac monitor for signs of activity .	1
they held their breath in vain : the monitor continued to report a single monotone sound of flat line .	1
still in v-fib , dr. stadler cried out .	1
desperation could be heard as he spoke .	1
fifty again , dr. warner called out once more .	1
he replaced the paddles in the previous locations and delivered a second charge .	1
again the tiny patient 's body convulsed .	1
as the three waited for the electrical shock to dissipate and reset the heart , the cardiac monitor registered a single beep , then another and still another as the young patient 's heart began to return to its singular function , pumping life 's blood once again through her tiny body .	1
sinus tach , dr. stadler cried out in relief .	1
dr. warner roughly placed paddles back on tray .	1
ultrasound ?	1
he asked dr. stadler , who had now resumed his examination , nervous sweat beading up on his brow .	1
belly 's full of blood .	1
looks like some major hemorrhaging where the bullet hit the spleen , pancreas and kidney .	1
eighth rib is broken too .	1
replied the dr. stadler , now regaining his composure .	1
ok , eight blade , dr. warner requested .	1
instantly , nurse edwards handed him a scalpel from the tray of stainless steel instruments , butt end first , taking care not to slice her own hand as she pulled away .	1
even with years of experience , the thought of slicing into the poor little girl that lay in front of him felt offensive .	1
dr. warner strengthened his resolve and made his incision , cutting through the various layers of tissue as blood flowed freely from the opening .	1
immediately the unmistakable stench of blood and fecal matter wafted through their protective masks .	1
he finished the incision and called , clamp .	1
nurse edwards placed the clamp in his hand .	1
dr warner positioned the clamp , holding open the incision as he tried to examine the damage through the draining blood .	1
suction , dr. warner called out .	1
dr. stadler inserted the probe into the incision and began to suck out the excess blood .	1
careful ; watch the trauma .	1
work around the transverse colon .	1
clean out as much of that fecal matter as possible , dr. warner cautioned as dr. stadler worked .	1
got it , dr. stadler replied , carefully sucking up the blood and debris from the abdominal cavity .	1
with a better view , dr. warner could now see the damaged organs more clearly .	1
it was apparent the spleen , pancreas and colon , as well as the left kidney had some form of trauma .	1
i need a 4-0 prolene and an r.b.-1 needle , now .	1
anyone know the caliber of bullet ?	1
dr warner asked , as nurse edwards handed him the needle and suture .	1
does n't look small , that 's all i know , replied dr. stadler , still suctioning the colon .	1
looks like about a .22 , dr. warner informed .	1
small entry wound , but heavy internal trauma from the shockwave as it passed through at the high velocity .	1
shockwave ?	1
asked nurse edwards .	1
while dr. warner worked to repair the damaged spleen , dr. stadler answered nurse edward 's question .	1
as a bullet travels , it pushes the air out of the way , creating a field of turbulent air around the bullet .	1
that air around the bullet , the shockwave , has almost as much destructive force as the bullet itself : so instead of a quarter of an inch bullet causing damage , you have to add the inch of shockwave to the problem too , dr. stadler said .	1
awful , just awful , nurse edwards replied sadly .	1
stats !	1
dr. warner called out as he quickly worked .	1
bp seventy-five over fifty , pulse ox eighty , replied nurse edwards she 's bleeding everywhere , dr. warner complained .	1
he turned to dr. stadler and instructed him to repair the transverse colon .	1
looks like we have a small puncture in the transverse colon .	1
can you repair it while i attend to the spleen ?	1
i 'm on it .	1
eight blade with suction , and a 4-0 and an r.b.-1 standing by , dr. stadler rattled off in quick succession to nurse edwards .	1
like a gentle father teaching his son , dr. warner delicately cautioned dr. stadler , one thing at a time , he said , then added , work frantically in control .	1
gotcha , dr. stadler replied , slightly embarrassed by his over zealousness .	1
as they both worked frantically to repair the damaged organs , the flow of blood went on nearly unabated .	1
nurse edwards kept a careful eye trained on the monitors as well as the doctors , anticipating their needs before their requests .	1
doctors , bp is dropping again , sixty-five over forty-eight .	1
pulse ox is very low : seventy-seven , nurse edwards announced .	1
dammit , where is she bleeding from ?	1
dr. warner asked rhetorically .	1
we 're working the areas now , dr. warner , dr. stadler replied .	1
no , no , with this much blood loss there has to be a much larger source , like the vena cava or the aorta , dr. warner speculated .	1
we 're nowhere near those areas .	1
the bullet exited out her back , through the kidneys , dr. stadler replied .	1
i know , but this much blood loss is n't adding up .	1
the bullet missed the renal and spleenic veins and arteries .	1
this ca n't be from just the organs , dr. warner replied .	1
the two doctors worked feverishly to repair the damaged and bleeding organs as the patients vitals continued to fall .	1
having repaired the spleen and the transverse colon , the two moved onto the pancreas and left kidney .	1
more suction , kerry , dr. warner instructed dr. stadler .	1
he then glanced up and asked nurse edwards , how 's our supply ?	1
she taking blood faster than we can give it , she retorted back instantly .	1
hang another two units , dr. warner requested anxiously .	1
dr. warner , do you see this ?	1
asked dr. stadler .	1
would you agree that the bullet entered the abdomen , broke the rib and continued through the spleen , pancreas and out the kidney ?	1
it appears that way , why ?	1
dr. warner asked as he worked on the kidney .	1
there seems to be an abrasion heading up into the upper posterior peritoneum , dr. stadler said , as he lifted the pancreas slightly and pointed to an abrasion that angled up toward the middle of the patients body instead of down and through it .	1
dammit , you know what that is ?	1
that 's another entry wound , dr. warner replied .	1
eight blade and sternal saw , stat !	1
he said to nurse edwards .	1
two bullets ?	1
but theres only one entry wound , dr. stadler replied in disbelief .	1
i know .	1
two bullets entered through the same location , dr. warner responded as he accepted the scalpel from nurse edwards and began to make a long incision down the patients breastbone .	1
i knew something was n't right .	1
a .22 caliber ca n't break a rib , then have enough energy remaining to tear through all these organs .	1
there had to be more than one bullet , and i 'm betting its also the cause for the massive blood loss , he explained as he finished his incision .	1
what are the odds of that happening ?	1
i mean , two bullets with the same entry wound ?	1
dr. stadler asked rhetorically , shaking his head now in further disbelief .	1
stenal saw , dr. warner asked next , then added , i never would have guessed it if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes .	1
quickly , nurse edwards handed dr. warner the saw .	1
placing it at the base of the sternum , he began to cut through the breastbone , the smell of bone and blood penetrating through their masks and into their nostrils .	1
moments later , he was done .	1
rib spreader , dr. warner requested .	1
anticipating his request , nurse edwards handed him the instrument immediately .	1
inserting it directly into the incision , he turned the lever and separated the ribs enough to view the upper chest cavity .	1
probe , dr. warner requested from nurse edwards .	1
he then called to dr. stadler to begin suctioning the open areas .	1
as he did , dr. warner examined the cleaned areas .	1
more suction .	1
i need more suction , dr. warner asked with frustration .	1
oh man , we have trauma to the inferior vena cava .	1
i need a 4-0 and an r.b.-1 , stat !	1
working feverishly to repair the profuse bleeding , the needle contacted something hard .	1
at first he thought it was a rib fragment , but upon closer inspection dr. warner realized it was the second bullet .	1
there it is .	1
forceps , dr. warner requested with an almost frantic tone .	1
he inserted the forceps into the cavity , gently pushing aside the still-bleeding vena cava and gently extracted the deformed and mangled bullet .	1
wow .	1
the edges are like tiny razor blades .	1
they sliced through the veins on contact , he announced .	1
there must be a dozen fissures to repair .	1
as he unceremoniously tossed the clamped bullet and forceps into a stainless steel container , he continued to suture the tears to the damaged vein and surrounding organs .	1
moments later , dr. warner watched as the heart began to slow .	1
just then , the cardiac monitor sounded .	1
he quickly placed his gloved fingers around the heart and began to squeeze , attempting manual heart compressions even before nurse edwards could speak .	1
doctor , she 's in pea , nurse edwards announced .	1
push another amp of epi and charge the internal paddles to fifteen , dr. warner demanded .	1
handing him the paddles , they watch as he inserted them into her chest cavity and placed them on the still heart .	1
clear , dr. warner called out he depressed the button and sent the shock directly into the young patients heart.as they listened for signs of life from the cardiac monitor , reality set in .	1
there were none to be heard .	1
charge to twenty .	1
another 6 milligrams now .	1
clear !	1
dr. warner frantically called again .	1
he shocked the heart , sending the current deep within , but to no effect .	1
the cardiac monitor continued to report its menacing tone flat line .	1
asystole god dammit .	1
dr. warner shouted out loud .	1
as he continued with manual compressions he called out once more , charge to thirty .	1
inserting the internal paddles again , he delivered a massive jolt to the patient 's heart .	1
in horror and sadness , they watched the monitor register no change .	1
dr. warner frantically searched his mind for a solution as he continued manual compressions .	1
even with his years of education and training , the damage was too extensive for him to overcome .	1
he pulled his hands from her chest and stood back .	1
with his gloved hands dripping fresh blood onto the floor , he hung his head low .	1
call it , he mumbled quietly .	1
as nurse edwards called the time of death , he stood motionless as he watched the lifeless body of the young girl .	1
his mind raced as he stared at the carnage in front of him .	1
he thought about the smiles she must have displayed just a few hours before .	1
he thought about the hugs her mom must have given her that morning , and the pain the parents would be feeling forever .	1
he thought about her violent death and the injustice of it all .	1
deeply saddened and sickened by the grievous sight , he could stand no more .	1
he turned and walked out the or doors , oblivious to all , in a state of shock and disbelief .	1
with his gown soaked in blood and his gloves dripping a red path behind him , he made his way down the corridor toward the elevator .	1
in a blurred and confused state , he was unable to hear his name being called as he walked .	1
standing in front of the elevator , he pushed the button .	1
instantly , the doors sprung open .	1
he looked back up the hallway to nurse edwards , who was calling his name , but heard nothing .	1
as if in slow motion , he stepped in and the doors slowly closed behind him .	1
dr. warner !	1
dr. warner , stop !	1
nurse edwards called as she ran down the corridor toward the elevator .	1
too late .	1
she watched as the doors closed behind him .	1
as she stared at the bloody footprints that seemed to vanish through the elevator doors , she caught a slight movement with her peripheral vision .	1
looking up , she watched with sadness as a droplet of blood pooled , then slide down from the elevator button .	1
reaching into her pocket , she pulled out a tissue and reverently wiped off the sad remains of the young victim , imprinting in her memory , forever the pain of the senseless tragedy .	1
in a daze , dr. david warner stood in the middle elevator and stared through an old photo hanging on the back wall .	1
as the metal doors closed behind him , he felt a small shudder , then a slight drop as he momentarily became weightless as the elevator began to descend .	1
ignoring the fact that he had not pressed a floor to descend to , he felt any place but the or was a good place .	1
he just wanted to forget .	1
slowly the elevator descended .	1
as david struggled to free his mind of tragedy , his eyes began to focus on the picture in front of him .	1
slowly at first , then more detailed as he descended , the photo came into focus .	1
he was no longer staring through the photo , but directly at it .	1
somehow it helped to soothe the pain that gnawed away at his soul .	1
the photo was an antique , a reflection of the past ; a unique display of history that showed how elanger hospital came to pass .	1
the photo was of a group of civil war doctors standing over a patient after a recent amputation .	1
at its center was the patient , laying on a makeshift gurney built from an old wooden wagon , sedated and bandaged , with his lower right leg , a stump , resting and on display as a testimony to the doctors abilities .	1
standing behind the patient , dressed in uniform with their bloody smocks still fastened to them , several military doctors stood proudly for the photo .	1
hardened and determined , their faces were devoid of all expression , save for one - pride .	1
at the left side of the photo sat an old man on a rickety stool .	1
with his white flowing beard and hair , he looked much older than his more distinguished-looking colleagues .	1
he too wore a bloody smock , and his face also carried the expression of pride .	1
yet something else shone through in the old mans eyes wisdom .	1
while the others looked into the camera , he looked beyond it , as if deep in thought and oblivious to its presence .	1
he appeared somewhat accidental to the photos purpose .	1
at the bottom of the photo , david read the inscription : original site of elanger hospital , 1862 .	1
david gazed upon the doctors in the photo .	1
he looked at the bandage , bulbous and barbaric on the poor soldiers leg .	1
a feeling of contempt swept over his body .	1
huh .	1
a hundred and fifty years of progress and we still cant save em , he shouted out irrationally , his fists clenched in anger and still encased in bloody gloves .	1
then , in a fit of rage , he punched the picture on the wall , the glass shattering and dropping to the floor of the elevator , cracking the cheap plastic frame .	1
the sound of shattering glass and cracking plastic snapped him back to reality .	1
he bent over and picked up the old photo , leaving the broken shards of glass still at the floor of the elevator .	1
he began to replace the picture on the bent hook when he felt his knees begin to buckle slightly as the elevator began to slow to a stop .	1
a moment later , david heard the sound of a bell as the elevator settled into its floor .	1
suddenly , he saw his gloved hands , sticky with drying blood , holding the framed picture held out in front of him .	1
he looked down at his gown and realized he was covered in blood , a fact that had escaped his attention moments before .	1
as the mechanized sound of the heavy metal doors signaled their opening , he felt a light balmy breeze brush by his neck .	1
the air suddenly felt dense , as if the relative humidity dramatically increased .	1
a strange yet familiar odor drifted from behind him and penetrated his nostrils .	1
turning around to investigate , he stiffened and froze in place .	1
as his eyes took in the sight before him , his mind struggled to make sense of the scene beyond the doors of the elevator .	1
his heart began to pump wildly and his whole body shook .	1
he felt he was dreaming : but never before had a dream felt so real .	1
hey , you .	1
come here .	1
i need you to hold his leg , david heard just outside the door of the elevator .	1
david squinted at first , then rubbed his eyes and refocused on the vision before him .	1
there , several yards away , he watched as a man dressed in a blue military uniform stood over another man laying on a wooden gurney .	1
the man standing looked familiar to him , and he searched his mind to make the connection .	1
hey , come here .	1
i need your help now .	1
im almost finished , the voice called again from beyond the elevator door .	1
david looked around inside the elevator , then over to the control panel .	1
at the bottom of the panel , a circular button labeled g was highlighted .	1
he thought it strange that he ended up at the ground floor , as he had not pushed any of the buttons on the panel .	1
he turned back to the scene that was unfolding in front of him .	1
the light , balmy breeze was still blowing in his face , and the strange odor , now foul and offensive , still penetrated his nostrils .	1
david watched in fascination as he realized the military man beckoning him was , in fact , a doctor performing crude surgery on the other man laying unconscious on the wooden gurney .	1
suddenly it dawned on him .	1
the man standing before him was the same man in the picture .	1
david looked at the picture in his hands , then back at the man beyond the elevator .	1
he was indeed the doctor ; the older-looking man with a white flowing beard and hair .	1
wow .	1
this is one strange dream , david said out loud .	1
he felt confused by the vision .	1
whoa , im seeing color in this dream .	1
how is this possible ?	1
he asked of no one in particular .	1
are you just going to stand there or are you going to help me ?	1
the old doctor called out to david in frustration .	1
david thought about answering him , but thought it to be silly .	1
its just a dream , he thought to himself .	1
then , reconsidering , he rationalized to himself , what would be the harm ?	1
david called to the old man , what do you want me to do ?	1
tear that cloth into strips , the old doctor responded immediately , pointing to a mound of cloth on the grass at the foot of the wagon .	1
at first , david hesitated .	1
something in his gut was telling him not to go .	1
he felt paralyzed with indecision , but then , throwing caution to the wind , he stepped forward .	1
as he passed through the doorway of the elevator and stepped out onto the grass , time seemed to slow for a moment .	1
he heard voices and sounds as if they were being played to him at half speed .	1
he turned and looked back into the elevator , but strangely , he saw only its interior : the hospital he expected to see housing it was not there .	1
david turned and took a step onto the grass .	1
time seemed to resume its normal speed .	1
he suddenly heard the deafening sounds of thunder and recognized the foul stench of rotting flesh .	1
he turned to look back at the elevator , but it was no longer there : only grass and birch trees , which partially obstructed the war that raged off in the distant valley .	1
what the hell ?	1
david said out loud , as a wave of fear and confusion spread through his body .	1
son , i really need your help here , david heard , as the old voice shouted from behind him .	1
david turned and looked at the old doctor , then back at the spot of grass that used to be the elevator .	1
suddenly , a loud clap of thunder sounded just beyond the birch trees , shaking the ground under his feet .	1
he heard screams of agony and realized that the sounds hed been hearing were not thunder after all , but were in fact artillery explosions .	1
instinctively , david ran toward the old doctor , frantically searching for cover as he closed the distance .	1
the old doctor , seeing the intense fear in davids eyes , quickly recognized the developing problem .	1
he pulled away from his patient and moved quickly to intercept david in flight .	1
whoa , son !	1
steady .	1
youre in no danger , the old doctor called to david as he ran to him and grabbed his arms , reassuring him of his safety .	1
those are bombs .	1
theyre trying to kill us , david replied , almost hysterical .	1
the doctor casually looked beyond david at the raging war , then back into his eyes , and replied , `` well , i suppose they are , but we 're out of range of their artillery . ''	1
he scratched the top of his head with his bloody fingernails and continued , `` i guess a wild bullet could accidentally find us up here , but it 's not likely , '' he then took a long look at david 's clothes .	1
a confused expression crossed his face as he spoke .	1
`` that is quite an unusual uniform you have on .	1
what outfit are you from ? ''	1
`` outfit ? ''	1
david replied , still in a deep state of shock .	1
`` outfit , lad .	1
what outfit are you from ?	1
who 's your commanding officer ? ''	1
the old doc questioned with a bit of suspicion , then added , `` do n't tell me you 're gray ? ''	1
david was about to speak when another shell hit a bank just beyond the birch trees , startling both he and the old doctor .	1
with a quick look over david 's shoulder , then back to his patient on the wooden wagon , the doctor refocused on his duty .	1
`` this way , lad .	1
we have work to do , '' the old doctor said , as he extended his hand in the direction of the patient as an invitation for david to follow him .	1
quickly , they walked back to the wagon , with the doctor leading the way .	1
once at the patients side , the old doctor instructed , `` i need you to tear those rags into thin strips so i can finish bandaging this poor lads stump before he comes to .	1
lord knows he 'll be suffering enough when he wakes without us fidgeting with his bandage , so be quick with your work . ''	1
david pulled off his rubber gloves and tucked them into his pocket .	1
with his mind struggling to make sense of the situation , he reached down and begin to tear the cloth into strips in an effort to buy himself time to sort through the complexities of his dream .	1
his mind raced from one topic to the next , never answering his questions as each problem became a pandoras box of other unanswerable questions , distracting and derailing him from solving anything .	1
as he looked around , he could hear the cries of agony , the sounds of war , the smell of death , and suddenly he realized that this was no dream .	1
this was real .	1
he was now existing in another era in time : the civil war the 1860s .	1
as he tore off each strip of cloth , he handed it to the old doctor , who used it to secure the amputee 's bandages in place .	1
as he worked , the old doctor began to interrogate his new assistant .	1
`` i see you 've been in surgery already .	1
i do n't recall another medical unit around here .	1
where did you come from ? ''	1
the old doctor asked casually as he worked .	1
david searched his mind for an answer that would be suitable for the old man .	1
he knew he could n't say he was from the future .	1
quickly he devised a cover story until he could make sense of his dilemma .	1
`` i have medical training and thought i could be of use , david replied , hoping his answer would suffice .	1
uh huh , and where did you come from ?	1
allow me to be more direct .	1
are you gray or blue ?	1
the old doctor asked without breaking his concentration .	1
doctor , i am neither .	1
i am just a medically trained individual who wants to lend a hand to these poor boys , david replied .	1
young man , are you a deserter ?	1
the old doctor asked bluntly .	1
no , sir .	1
i am not in the military , david responded .	1
he knew the questions would keep coming and that he needed to find a better reason for his presence .	1
he then had an idea .	1
doctor , the truth is i need a job .	1
id like to join the military to in order to practice medicine .	1
i am a very skilled practitioner and feel i can be of real use here , david finished , hoping he hadnt overplayed his abilities .	1
hmm , skilled practitioner you say ?	1
where were you trained ?	1
are you a doctor ?	1
the old doctor said , continuing his interrogation .	1
yes , i am a doctor .	1
i was trained in new england at harvard university .	1
have you heard of it ?	1
david asked , unsure if his ivy league alma mater wouldnt raise even more suspicion .	1
harvard you say ?	1
hmm .	1
we are short-staffed here , to be sure .	1
my assistants mean well but are bumbling country boys , if you understand my inference , the old doctor said as he winked at david .	1
completely , doctor , david replied back with a smile of understanding .	1
well , doctor , do you have a name ?	1
the old doctor asked , now warming to david a bit .	1
yes sir .	1
my name is dr. david warner .	1
may i ask what your name is ?	1
david responded in kind .	1
certainly .	1
my name is jebadiah morgan , dr. morgan replied , his modesty eliminating fancy titles from his name .	1
he tied the last bandage and lifted his head .	1
with piercing eyes , he stared directly into davids .	1
slowly , he extended his hand in greeting .	1
im pleased to make your acquaintance , david .	1
now , if you will indulge me a while , id like to see your abilities .	1
i have a young man waiting amputation id like you to attend to .	1
if you prove your skill , i will consult with gen. negley regarding employment .	1
is this accord satisfactory ?	1
dr. morgan asked with blunt sincerity .	1
where 's the patient ?	1
david replied , trying to contain his confidence .	1
dr. morgan signaled to the private to bring up the next patient .	1
as they waited , he showed david to his station , pointing out the instruments he 'd be operating with , as well as suturing materials and bandaging .	1
david viewed his crude operating environment with shock .	1
he had n't thought about it until that moment , but he was trained to operate in a highly technical environment .	1
this was as primitive as he could imagine .	1
he was n't sure he could do it .	1
dr. morgan sensed davids apprehension and said , son , are you sure you 're up for this ?	1
it 's a bit more primitive than i 'm used to , but i can manage , david replied .	1
son , i do n't want you to manage .	1
i want you to perform as a trained operator .	1
these young men deserve more than a butcher or a charlatan .	1
if you are either , please speak the truth , dr. morgan stated boldly and with conviction .	1
doctor , i can assure you my skills as a surgeon are more than adequate .	1
i just need a moment to acclimate myself to an environment i 'm not accustomed to , david replied with a bold and confident tone , in an effort to reassure dr. morgan .	1
as the assistants laid the next patient on the wooden wagon , david could see the agony of the young soldier and immediately began his assessment .	1
without the basic equipment to understand the patients vital signs , david could only make limited observations .	1
he quickly took the patients pulse and determined it to be weaker than normal .	1
next , he checked pupil dilation and reaction with a match .	1
satisfied , he then examined the patient 's mouth , tongue and skin for dehydration and color .	1
he observed that his skin color was pale and felt clammy .	1
in addition , the young man seemed somewhat withdrawn and lethargic .	1
trying not to move the traumatized leg too much , he moved it only slightly , cutting away the pant leg .	1
he observed that a large caliber bullet had indeed passed through the calf , but had left a gaping wound upon exiting .	1
david determined that with careful cleaning and repair , the leg could be saved , although without antibiotics , the post treatment would be problematic .	1
david immediately bent the young man 's undamaged leg at the knee , leaving the traumatized leg laying flat .	1
he then moved to the front of the wagon , grabbed a blanket , and draped it over the patient .	1
`` dr. warner , what is your assessment ? ''	1
dr. morgan questioned with concern .	1
`` the patient is suffering from mild hypovolemic shock .	1
i am making some effort to stabilize him before invasive surgery .	1
the large bore bullet has indeed left a great deal of trauma to the calf , but i believe i can save the leg . ''	1
david recalled from his courses in school that the anesthesia of choice during this period was chloroform .	1
he continued , `` do we have the chloroform ready ? ''	1
david asked .	1
`` doctor , i must protest .	1
his leg is too badly damaged .	1
we must remove it before gangrene develops , '' dr. morgan said .	1
`` i 've examined the wound and feel it is relatively clean , thanks to his pant leg protecting the trauma .	1
after a proper cleaning , i can repair the muscle , veins and arteries , but will need a strong cleansing solution and freshly boiled water .	1
i believe he will have some degree of infection , but the chance of gangrene is much lower than you might think , '' david replied .	1
`` repair the veins and arteries ?	1
is this possible ? ''	1
dr. morgan asked incredulously , then added with great concern , `` and what if the infection spreads and gangrene develops ? ''	1
`` we 'd amputate , but then he 'd be no worse off than if we had amputated now .	1
at least we give him a chance to save the leg , '' david reasoned .	1
`` hmm .	1
you really think you can do this ?	1
save his leg ? ''	1
dr. morgan asked , now intrigued by david 's plan .	1
`` i can only assure you he wo n't die under my care , though saving his leg under these conditions is n't going to be easy , '' david responded .	1
dr. morgan coifed his long white beard as he contemplated the procedure .	1
he looked over at the patient , then back at david , deep in worry as he struggled to trust this mysterious doctor who appeared just minutes before .	1
david could see the old man 's forehead furrow as he thought .	1
a moment later , david saw the worried expression leave the old man 's face .	1
he now began to smile a bit as he came to grips with his decision .	1
`` ok , son .	1
tell me exactly what you need , '' dr. morgan finally replied .	1
`` two pots of boiling water , distilled or grain alcohol , soap , and clean dressings , '' david replied .	1
`` it 's going to take some time to collect these things .	1
is every operation like this ? ''	1
dr. morgan asked .	1
`` keeping the water boiling is the only time consuming consideration , '' david responded .	1
a fire had already been smoldering from early morning usage , so dr. morgan tossed more wood on the coals .	1
twenty minutes later , two pots of water boiled wildly as david sorted through dr. morgan 's limited instruments required to perform the surgery .	1
resigned to his selection , david placed the instruments into the boiling water for sterilization .	1
he then poured off some of the boiling water into third pot and began to scrub his hands and arms with the soap , as well as the rubber gloves he had in his pocket .	1
satisfied with his cleansing , he slowly washed away the soap .	1
dr. morgan looked on ill-amused with the display by this strange doctor .	1
a man of medicine for more than thirty-five years , he regarded the prep work as shenanigans reserved for roadside carpetbaggers as a means to disguise their lack of content .	1
david looked over and could see the contempt in dr. morgans eyes .	1
he knew the old doctor was losing his patience , and with that lost , he too was losing what little credibility he might have had .	1
quickly , david set up next to the young soldier .	1
with the help of the old doctor , the patient was anesthetized in a matter of minutes .	1
with the patient out , dr. morgan looked on closely .	1
david put on his now-sterilized gloves , and then applied a generous amount of the moonshine he obtained from the old doctor to the area around the wound in an effort to sterilize it .	1
ok , doctor : as you can see , the patients leg is torn up pretty badly .	1
im going to make an incision through the back of the calf to inspect and then repair any damage i might find , david started .	1
with the patients legs bent at the knees and rolled to one side so he had a clear view , he made an incision across the entry wound large enough to view inside when spread apart .	1
as if on cue , dr. morgan moved in for a closer look .	1
david then brought out a pair of retractors used to hold open an incision .	1
he delicately placed the instrument in the incision and expanded it , giving him a good view of the wound .	1
next , he rinsed out the incision with a salted water solution he had prepared before the surgery .	1
dabbing the excess blood , he was able to see the damaged muscle tissue and a torn vein .	1
using his scalpel , he cut away the torn and mangled muscle tissue .	1
again , he rinsed out the interior of the wound with moonshine and his makeshift saline solution .	1
with the smallest needle from the old doctors bag of instruments , david began to sew the reconstructed muscles as well as the arteries , using very few sutures to accomplish his task .	1
now , the sutures will remain there forever , but the body will adapt to them .	1
i believe this should take care of this side of the wound , david replied softly , completely engrossed in his work .	1
he closed the entry wound and move onto the more extensive damage on the other side of the calf .	1
dr. morgan looked on in total fascination .	1
never before had he seen or even heard of surgery so delicate and so complicated performed with such ease and skill .	1
eagerly , he waited for david to attempt the more difficult area of the operation .	1
after watching the first phase of the operation , david had indeed proven himself to be a quite gifted surgeon .	1
dr. morgan now watched as any spectator would watch a professional in his element .	1
he was in awe and excited to observe even greater feats of medicine .	1
once again , david did his best to rinse and clean the wound with the salted water solution , and then sterilize it with the distilled alcohol .	1
pulling the scalpel from the hot water , he began to work the damaged muscle tissue on the exit wound .	1
the damage was much more extensive , but manageable .	1
as he removed tissue , he would temporarily close the wound to ensure the proper shape of the reconstruction .	1
working quickly , he then began to suture the arteries and muscle as he had done on the previous side , using very few stitches to accomplish the task .	1
he then closed the wound as he had done on the other side .	1
when completed , he rinsed again and sterilized the entire area with the alcohol .	1
with the operation over , he began to bandage the wound .	1
a few minutes later , as the patient was gaining consciousness , david had tied the last bandage .	1
the operation was now over and david felt confident he had done his best to inhibit infection .	1
in a days time , the results of his work would be evident .	1
all he could do now was to wait .	1

how often do you hear a review say that ?	1
well .	1
thats what im saying .	1
other reviews describing it as near perfection and incredibly well written arent lying .	1
russell blake is on par with the biggest names in the business .	1
and i mean grisham , turrow , ludlum , forsyth , brown .	1
the plot is intricate and completely unexpected at every turn .	1
al ross is a hateful , extremely well-written character with believable complexity and nuance , plunged into a global conspiracy nightmare hes ill-equipped to survive .	1
dont want to spoil the end , but its a barn-burner .	1
overall , the best read ever . ''	1
jennifer989 `` the artistry in this work as the brush strokes build layers , brings you to wonder if something like this could be true !	1
thats the work of a true artist .	1
many works of fiction have a main character that is so scrubbed up that he no longer resembles a human male .	1
no problems with this one .	1
you start out despising him , then start to feel sorry for him , until finally you almost like him and wish him well - although that outcome seems unlikely , the way the story develops .	1
this is almost a how to.. for budding writers .	1
how to write without one word or one sentence that could be edited out !	1
tight narrative , great story , scary scenario .	1
i almost never give five stars , but this has earned it ! ''	1
k. mcdicken `` russell blake is fast becoming my favorite new author .	1
take an unlikely main character , a scarily probable conspiracy , a government run amok , cocaine dealers , commandos , whores , a burro , and a tightly meshed action/intrigue plot , and you have what to me is the most original thriller of the year .	1
i dont want to spoil the ending but it completely blew me away , and how the suspense was sustained to the last few pages as a surprise was great .	1
i loved fatal exchange and had tears of laughter running down my face for how to sell a gazillion ebooks , and now spent a big chunk of my night reading till 4am to get to the end of geronimo breach .	1
highest recommendation for a highly original and entertaining novel . ''	1
semi-used `` okay , im from the other side of the pond ( you can find most of my reviews and on the uk site ) and im not a patient/forgiving reader if the writer confuses me or dawdles in their narrative .	1
i was pleasantly surprised to find myself going along with the easy style and broad strokes of the narrative .	1
the plot is very skillfully contrived but the real art i found was in the affinity i found myself unable to resist with the down-on-his-life main character , al .	1
i also love burros after following als steady transition as he encounters hurdle after hurdle .	1
i laughed aloud in some scenes ( i wont spoil it ) when al is , lets say ... compromised .	1
i loved the ending but also wished the story hadnt ended - so for that reason im taking the trouble to recommend it . ''	1
write into print for the `` zero sum trilogy '' `` blakes latest is absolutely amazing .	1
i literally could not put down my kindle until i finished all three books in the trilogy !	1
russell blake has a very unique talent at painting a beautiful story with words , and the zero sum trilogy practically reads like poetry .	1
5 stars arent enough to rate this wonderful trilogy : 10 stars would be more accurate ! ''	1
amber norrgard `` russell blakes zero sum trilogy is truly amazing .	1
i initially downloaded book 1 because it was free and before i was done i had purchased the book 2 & 3 bundle .	1

marilou george ( the kindle book review ) `` i read a review of the zero sum trilogy on steven konkolys blog , and then several reviews here , so i took the plunge .	1
i mean , i dont know a put from a call ( though i did get a short lesson from mr. blake when i mentioned that ) but that didnt stop me from enjoying this thrill ride .	1
i was recuperating from a medical procedure , so i read all three books over the weekend .	1
i even kept a map of one of the locations open on the computer and that made the story all the more vivid .	1
the hero was smart , made good use of his resources , yet still kept a bit of naivete that had some almost disastrous results .	1
there was a bit of irony at the end , but it worked .	1

during the chaotic and breakneck writing of that epic tale , i was constantly struck by fleeting insights into the mind of the killer , some of which i captured in glowing detail in that tome .	1
but even as i put king of swords to bed , i couldnt shake the sense of unfinished business .	1
id go to sleep and have vivid dreams , and they were always the same about the characters in my book .	1
specifically , they were about the assassins past .	1
it was like a disease .	1
i couldnt stop thinking about him .	1
thats unfamiliar to me , for the most part .	1
i had the same general sense when i got done with al , from the geronimo breach , but i had no compulsion to write another book about him , fascinating as his character is .	1
i felt closure at the end of that work .	1
id told als story , as well as i could , and there wasnt more i felt i could add .	1
there were no more words that needed writing .	1
but i no sooner finished king of swords than i started making notes for a prequel .	1
which is really the wrong way to go about it .	1
im a simple man .	1
when starting a story , i always like the once upon a time part at the beginning , and the end at , well , the end .	1
but thats not how it panned out for me this time .	1
i felt driven to write about the assassin some more , and to delve into his background .	1
what created a man who could dispassionately terminate peoples lives for a living ?	1
what drove him to do the unthinkable ?	1
was he a monster in the traditional sense ?	1
did he kick dogs or swerve to hit them in the road ?	1
did he put his socks on before or after his underwear ?	1
it was fascinating to me , because el rey was alive in my head .	1
you see , i knew the answers to the questions i was asking , for once in my life .	1
and so it came to pass that i have the opportunity to share with you what i gleaned from him .	1
night of the assassin is a somewhat shorter work , written to flesh out the making of the beast , and is best read as a companion piece after king of swords .	1
it can certainly be read first , but i suspect it will be more satisfying and resonate more if the reader digests king first , night second , then the sequels .	1
thats how i envisioned it , but youre free to do as you like .	1
even if read as a stand-alone or first , night should entertain and satisfy .	1
id just recommend it after king .	1
night of the assassin is a classic prequel , in that it doesnt repeat information already memorialized in king of swords so there may be some gaps that dont seem to make sense until both novels are read .	1
nights purpose , other than to thrill , is to explain , to afford illumination into one of my most fascinating characters yet .	1
el reys past , or at least the highlights of it , are alive on the page .	1
if ive done my job right , youll be hurtled along on a ride like no other , to be at times shocked , titillated , revolted , sad , and ultimately , swept into a dark world of cartel killers and violence , drug deals and paid executions , love and loss .	1
enjoy this humble offering , with my compliments .	1
your servant , russell blake night of the assassin chapter 1 midnight , five years ago , manzanillo , mexico the lights from contessa , a 160-foot christensen super yacht , glowed off the calm surface of the harbor below the grand bay hotel in barra de navidad , twenty-six miles northwest of manzanillo the primary deep water port on the pacific coast of mainland mexico .	1
it was a calm spring night , the air heavy with the scent of the ubiquitous tropical flowers , beaded with moisture from the cloudbursts that had sulked over the hazy , humid day .	1
crickets trilled their mating mantras beneath the broiling heavens , the only sound on the water besides the dull thumping of the disco beat emanating from the massive boats salon , which lay beneath the superstructure that supported a four-passenger helicopter and a complement of jet skis .	1
the creaking lines of the yacht strained as the tide rolled in and the moons perennial pull drew higher the water level in the marina ; the heavy ropes that secured the ship to its long concrete dock keened in futile protest .	1
armed security men clad in black windbreakers patrolled the concrete walkway that curved the length of the exclusive private marina , the unmistakable outline of heckler & koch ump submachine guns a silent testament to their intent .	1
the battle-hardened men chartered with the safety of those aboard the yacht were dead serious , resonating a constant state of readiness against threats from any approach .	1
the drug cartel skirmishes had escalated over the past two years the guards had been in some blistering firefights with rival groups and seen more than their share of blood .	1
these were men for whom killing was routine , and they drew their pay with the understanding that any day might be their last .	1
a radio crackled as the group members checked in with one another , each confirming that all was calm .	1
the routine was to monitor everyones status at fifteen minute intervals throughout the night .	1
if danger came , it often did so in the wee hours , and the groups leader was keenly sensitive to possible fatigue or boredom a luxury that could prove fatal on that detail .	1
peals of shrill female laughter pierced the night as the salon sliding door opened to allow three scantily clad young mexican women onto the rear deck , where the ashtrays were located near a well-stocked bar and a sumptuous oversized hot tub .	1
the girls were regular company for the owner of the boat , sylvio contreras , the number one warlord in sonora and the head of the zapata cartel .	1
not one was older than nineteen , the youngest seventeen papi contreras liked his meat fresh and tender , the more so since hed celebrated his fiftieth birthday the prior week .	1
he could certainly afford the best , and there was a constant stream of eager girls interested in exchanging their charms for his largesse ; contreras controlled a significant chunk of the colombian cocaine and mexican methamphetamine traffic that made its way through sonora to the united states , and his annual personal take from the trade exceeded one billion u.s. dollars per year .	1
contessa was one of three yachts papi owned the larger ones were on the eastern shore of mexico and in costa rica , one docked in cozumel and the other bouncing around central american ports as its owners whims dictated .	1
contessa was more of a weekend getaway destination , a quick hop from home , whereas the others were good for several weeks aboard .	1
papi burned roughly twelve million dollars a year keeping his boats in the water before even starting the engines .	1
they were ready for him at any hour , staffed with full-time crews consisting of captains , chefs , deckhands , mechanics , maids , bartenders and masseuses .	1
security travelled with him at an extra cost .	1
then again , papi wasnt price-sensitive , and couldnt have told anyone precisely what he spent on his lifestyle .	1
he knew that his plane had cost forty million , and this boat a hundred and twenty , with the others roughly a quarter billion , but when you were rolling a billion or more bucks a year , what did it matter ?	1
the total hed lavished on toys amounted to what he would clear by june , so it had long ago ceased to have any meaning .	1
the girls were in high spirits , fueled by a combination of tequila and cocaine , which was one of the other reasons why a place by papis side was coveted you had access to all the high-grade chemical supplementation you could want , in addition to the lavish financial generosity afforded to his female companions .	1
they blew smoke and chatted about clothes and their favorite television programs , taking a break from the fiesta that was winding down inside .	1
contreras had begun his birthday bash several weeks earlier and had decided to make it a month-long event , hopping from destination to destination with his entourage , which consisted of his brother and a group of five or six girls , accompanied by a security detail of two dozen mercenaries .	1
they flew in a 727 hed acquired for next to nothing when it was put out of service by an american airline and , after ten million in refurbishments at a friends factory in costa rica , it served as his flying army headquarters .	1
tensions were high between the zapatas and the gulf cartel , as well as the sinaloa cartel , and the outbreaks of violence had escalated until the death toll reached into the hundreds each month .	1
as with most of the disagreements that resolved in bloody skirmishes , this one had to do with power and money .	1
the sinaloa cartel felt that sonora was making too much from its relatively insignificant place in the food chain , and was trying to dis-intermediate contreras in order to increase its net .	1
the gulf cartel was more personal contreras had butchered the family of one of the gulfs ranking captains over some real or imagined slight , and that had ignited a blood feud between the two organizations .	1
all of which was just humdrum business for contreras , who was one of the oldest of the living cartel bosses .	1
hed invented many of the tactics that were now standard in settling disputes , including beheadings , mass executions with bodies left in prominent places as a warning , the murder of judges and cops , and grenade attacks in densely populated urban areas .	1
contreras was a maverick in the trade , an innovator , who more than most understood that if you didnt have someone trying to kill you every moment , you were doing something wrong .	1
contreras had sent the staff and his brother away to stay the night in the hotel perched above the marina so he could enjoy his debauched party with just his companions .	1
he enjoyed his privacy immensely , even though in his line of work it was a commodity rarer than gold .	1
as a cartel head , he was constantly surrounded by security personnel so part of the appeal of his boats was the ability to enjoy at least the illusion of seclusion .	1
the door to the salon slid open again and a heavyset hirsute man with a bushy graying moustache and tousled curly black hair , wearing a versace silk bathrobe and lambskin slippers walked out onto the deck , gesturing to the girls with an unlit cohiba in his right hand .	1
the youngest , veronica , leapt to her feet with a lighter and rushed to attend to their host .	1
contreras smiled at her as he puffed on the hand-rolled cuban cigar , and playfully slapped one of her perfectly-sculpted buttocks after fondling it through her white mini-booty shorts for a few moments .	1
oh , papi !	1
she exclaimed with a giggle , faux indignation and petulance dripping from every syllable .	1
eh , so how you girls doing ?	1
you ready to make a party with your papi ?	1
come on .	1
you know how i like it , contreras rasped in his distinctive sonoran accent .	1
the girls extinguished their cigarettes and exchanged glances .	1
it was show time .	1
veronica moved to her two new friends and they began kissing , then caressing each other .	1
contreras stood by , watching impassively as the action moved from tepid to hot , and clothes began shedding along with any remaining inhibitions .	1
smooth , creamy-brown skin rubbed against the cushions of the semi-oval exterior seating area , and soon the girls were largely naked , other than a captains hat the oldest , ana , kept perched precariously on her head even as veronicas probing tongue demanded her attention .	1
papi opened a small eighteen-carat gold box and quickly tapped out two small piles of white powder on the glass exterior bar behind him .	1
he snorted the heaping lines of cocaine laced with levitra with gusto as he leered at the mnage a trois .	1
he shook his head and stamped his foot against the teak deck in what he imagined resembled a wild bulls mating display before throwing his head back and grinning crookedly at the moon as it struggled to break through the gathered clouds .	1
it was a good life ; he was a lucky man .	1
this had been a fantastic birthday so far and whoever had said that life began at fifty wasnt lying .	1
he reached below the bar and extracted a bottle of herradura seleccin suprema tequila and poured a healthy slug of the amber promise into a tumbler before returning his attention to the nubile entertainment .	1
yes indeed , a great birthday .	1
he studied the face of his platinum rolex masterpiece and noted the time a little after midnight .	1
another day older and closer to death .	1
ah , well .	1
what was one to do ?	1
hed try to enjoy himself nonetheless .	1
ladies .	1
youre shameless .	1
move inside and let the games begin .	1
and save some love for papi !	1
the security team studiously avoided looking up at the transom of the huge ship , preferring to scan the periphery for signs of intruders .	1
papis love for the high life was well known and by now the men had seen everything .	1
it was all fun until he couldnt perform or things turned nasty after too many drugs and the girls ended up begging for forgiveness .	1
theyd had to bury their fair share of young strippers who had failed to judge his moods correctly .	1
he was infamous for being mercurial .	1
a career as a playmate for a narcotraficante was a high-risk , high-reward proposition in a world where the men were inured to violence and thought nothing of snuffing out life on virtually any premise , including because it amused them to do so .	1
a pelican rustled its feathers at the waters edge before taking flight , swooping low over the water as it searched out more tranquil surroundings .	1
two of the sentries swung around at the sound , ready to engage whatever enemy presented itself .	1
they exhaled with relief when they saw the huge bird lumber into the night air .	1
everyones nerves were raw from the prior weeks duty , moving from danger zone to danger zone while contreras partied without a care .	1
they were in friendly territory but that counted for little when he was exposed like this .	1
every moment held the possibility of an attack by enemies who were every bit as vicious and determined as papi , and when he wasnt in his fortified compound back home , the risk-factor went through the roof .	1
the men were working in shifts , eight guards each shift , four hours on , eight off , so they could steal some rest and stay alert .	1
after four hours of high-intensity patrolling , acuity fell off markedly and human error became more likely .	1
the cartel game was one where you only got to make one mistake your last .	1
papi was paying the highest rates in the world for his security ; they wanted for nothing , but in return , he expected them to keep him safe no matter what , and if that meant every member of the team taking a bullet for him , so be it .	1
that was the gig .	1
the sound of the party from the boat was a headache for them , although no one would dare mention it to papi .	1
but he might as well have painted a big bulls-eye on the super yachts bow for any hostiles in the area .	1
the head of security , alberto , clenched his jaw as the women laughed , each squeal of ecstasy an invitation to disasterin his mind .	1
the old pervert ought to restrict banging around with his doped-up teenagers inside the goddamned boat , not out in the open .	1
why did he need to make such a public display of it ?	1
it was recklessly endangering them all .	1
he sucked down his frustration and concentrated on the job at hand , eyes scanning the surrounding dock area and the buildings for any hint of latent danger .	1
theyd be back at contreras home compound tomorrow afternoon , and so far there had been no attacks ; with any luck theyd make it back without incident , where the routine drill would be executed in a more controlled environment where they knew everyone and owned the town .	1
this was making him nervous exposed on the water , a million miles from nowhere with the boss kite-high on powder and bellowing into the night sky as though he was safe in his own living room .	1
a cat scurried after a large rat on the slick-wet concrete path by the shops at the far end of the marina , setting albertos nerves further on edge .	1
he didnt want to think of how wound-up his men must be after almost ten days of constant vigilance .	1
all he needed was a trigger-happy lapse and theyd have the police and military landing on them , which would be a little awkward given that papi was the number four most wanted man in mexico .	1
money obviously bought selective vision where he was concerned , but it would only go so far .	1
gunfire at a six star hotels exclusive marina could raise the wrong eyebrows and the last thing alberto needed was an all-out gun battle with the military in the dead of night .	1
he silently cursed contreras for being so careless , then exhaled a sigh of relief when he heard the drug lord call his whores back inside the boat with him .	1
alberto had six men on land , two on the boat , and one on each side of the bridge superstructure keeping watch for any potential menace that they might miss from the dock .	1
it would be impossible to sneak up on the yacht from the water in the still of the night a boat would be immediately detected , even if it was being rowed .	1
but he wanted to ensure that all avenues of attack were covered , so even the waterside was being watched .	1
contessa was docked on a side tie , her port side fastened to the pilings and the starboard side facing the harbor opening , beyond which the bay stretched into a black nothingness .	1
if there was going to be an assault it would have to come from the land because theyd have enough warning from the ships radar to take positions on the waterside and cut any encroaching vessel to pieces .	1
theyd covered all possible approaches yet he was still worried .	1
maybe it was the place , or maybe because it was the last night of papis latest binge .	1
but alberto had an ugly feeling in his guts and it wasnt something hed eaten .	1
his primeval senses tingled as if there was something out there coming for them .	1
and whatever it was , it meant them harm .	1
he called to his men for their radio check-in ; everyone responded immediately , sounding alert and precise .	1
they were the best .	1
seasoned professional killers from a half dozen countries , making thirty-five grand a month each to lay their lives on the line .	1
he didnt like the odds of anyone foolish enough to take them on in the dead of night .	1
but his gut still told him they had a problem .	1
the assassin checked the luminescent face of his stopwatch , noting with satisfaction that he was on schedule .	1
he listened for the sound of the party at the marina , which was still some distance away .	1
faint gusts of music muttered a vague cadence over the water .	1
the target was making it almost too easy for him .	1
perhaps it was just providence calling time on papi .	1
but whatever the wheels within wheels of cruel nature , he thanked his lucky stars that hed taken this contract one of the largest hed ever been offered , at a million and a half dollars .	1
hed planned the attack to the second and researched everything from the marina layout to the surroundings , even going as far as locating blueprints and a schematic for the ship and committing them to memory .	1
this was his specialty the impossible to carry-off execution of untouchables was his stock-in-trade .	1
it had made him infamous in a relatively short time .	1
but this would be the most difficult sanction yet , due to the heightened vigilance of the security team he knew would be on-edge the final night of their rough duty , which concluded in a vulnerable location .	1
hed thought through all possible ways of terminating contreras , and when hed decided on his final plan , even he was impressed at the ingenuity of it .	1
now he just needed his contractors to be on time and to do their job , and papi was better than dead .	1
he slipped below the surface of the water and submerged to a depth of fifteen feet .	1
that would be sufficient for his purposes .	1
the small waterproof gps unit hed programmed with the coordinates of the dock radiated an orange glow that was readable from three feet away .	1
by his calculations , he would need ten minutes to swim to his starting position before the plan engaged , though hed allowed himself fifteen , just in case .	1
better safe than sorry on a night like this .	1
his tank held sufficient air to breathe for an hour , which he hoped would be far more than necessary .	1
it had been difficult arranging for all the pieces hed need to end the life of the brutal cartel boss ; expensive too , but sometimes cost was key .	1
hed learned through harsh experience not to pinch pennies or cheap out .	1
by the end of the night hed be far richer , so in the end , whatever his sunk costs were would have paid for themselves .	1
he was nothing if not pragmatic about the job .	1
his easy , practiced stroke propelled him smoothly through the warm water as he neared the private marina .	1
he sensed he was close when he felt a current heralding the mouth of the harbor , as the surging tide pulled him through the broad opening .	1
visibility was zero in the inky darkness so he was flying entirely by his instruments , which told him he had another hundred and fifty yards to go .	1
contessa was berthed at the dock closest to the harbors entrance , commanding the entire length , so there was no cover or alternative to doing the dive .	1
this was the only way to get close .	1
a commotion from the sea bed startled him with a cloud of muddy sediment .	1
a large stingray rose from the muck and glided by him , nudging his neoprene-encased legs with one of its wings .	1
more sensing the creature than seeing it , he was momentarily caught off guard .	1
his respiration increased as he flailed in alarm , causing a rush of bubbles to hurtle to the surface .	1
battling for control over his breathing , he struggled to slow his heart rate after a few seconds of inward composure , he had it back to beating at a moderate pace .	1
he didnt pause long to dwell on the near-miss , beyond musing that it would be ironic if his meticulously plotted assassination fell apart due to surface froth from a panicked brush with a bottom-dwelling myliobatoidei .	1
another glance at his watch confirmed that he still had five minutes to go .	1
by his reckoning he should be sixty or so yards from the front of the boat , and ninety from his targeted position .	1
after a few more moments of swimming , he dimly registered the hull of the massive ship above him an opaque outline floating on an already dark surface , faintly illuminated by lambent swirls of the surrounding marina lights .	1
carefully calculating the distance , he moved to the spot his schematics told him would be the correct one for his purposes .	1
from a mesh sack attached to his dive belt , he fished out a suction cup with a handle on one end , which he affixed to the hull .	1
the assassin could feel the vibration of the big generators that provided all the power when the massive twin mtu turbo-diesels were at rest .	1
as expected , all systems were operating at full bore on the luxurious yacht .	1
he extracted a waterproof battery-powered drill , and after taking one final confirming look at his position on the hull , he jammed the bit against the fiberglass and depressed the trigger .	1
the diamond-tipped steel shredded its way through hard , fibrous material almost five inches thick .	1
the bit was six .	1
two minutes later he was through .	1
he dropped the drill back into his sack and extracted a small gas canister with a rotating valve on the end , where it connected to a custom-fabricated seven-inch tube that would be a snug fit in the hole .	1
he jammed it up into the new opening and twisted the valve , wishing he could hear the satisfying hiss that would terminate the target .	1
hopefully .	1
that was where part two of the plan came in .	1
the assassin depressed a button on the suction cup and it dropped away from the hull .	1
he swam to the far side of the ship that was facing the bay and cautiously poked his head out of the water , right next to the section where the engine vents drew in air .	1
another glance at his watch confirmed that he had a hundred and forty more seconds before it was show time .	1
he groped in the sack and , after re-submerging , drilled another hole , this time where the central air conditioning units were situated .	1
he repeated the procedure with a second gas canister and returned to the surface again , hurriedly extending a telescopic tube akin to a car radio antenna .	1
the assassin fitted a third , larger canister onto the end of the extension and , now in position and prepared , waited for the fireworks to begin .	1
alberto was the first to hear the big choppers rotors .	1
by the time he had radioed to his men , the sound of the aircraft had increased to a chattering roar .	1
a searchlight stabbed through the night , racing over the buildings and then towards the marina , tracing over the assembled boats until it finally alighted on contessas towering mass , blinding the two armed sentries in the top-level bridge .	1
alberto screamed into the radio to his men to hold their fire nobody from the helicopter was shooting .	1
the piercing light slowly moved along the concrete path , locking onto the armed men and freezing each in place before it moved on to the next .	1
eventually , satisfied that there was no unusual mischief going on at the marina , the beam shut off and the chopper rose , hovering for another twenty seconds before banking and moving back towards its home base in manzanillo .	1
alberto swore to himself .	1
that had been way too close .	1
it was one of the navy copters , no doubt sent over to check on reports of armed men on the waterfront .	1
the army and the navy chiefs in the area had been paid off , so there shouldnt have been any problem .	1
it likely took a couple of radio exchanges before they called off the dogs .	1
few things in life scared alberto , but the prospect of taking on a contingent of armed mexican marines was one of them ; the army wasnt a problem , but the marines knew their shit .	1
they were the equivalent of the american green berets , the toughest of the tough , and they generally meant business .	1
alberto should know : he employed three ex-marines who were genuine , authentic hard cases even in a world where blood was spilled casually on a daily basis .	1
the unexpected fire-drill over , the patrols commenced again .	1
everything returned to a fragile calm .	1
the night was still , and contessa gently rocked against the swell of the incoming tide , the music from within still booming its siren song into the deep .	1
the assassin made his way through the cabin to the main stateroom , his silenced pistol at the ready .	1
hed brought it in a waterproof bag , in which he kept anything that shouldnt get immersed during the dive .	1
he didnt think hed need to use it , but better to be prepared .	1
hed pulled his flippers off and set them on the rear deck , where he could grab them in a hurry .	1
worst case , he could always swim without them , although it would be much rougher going .	1
that wasnt his most pressing problem now , though .	1
he needed to memorialize his success and get the proof back to his clients so he could collect the second half of his fee and build his reputation in the process .	1
he pushed the door to the master stateroom open and encountered a tableaux straight out of hell .	1
papi lay naked in the center of the bed , surrounded by his three young playmates , also naked .	1
all were dead .	1
the nerve gas hed bought from the russians had done its work , circulating via the three zoned air conditioners .	1
hed been guaranteed that the gas would kill within ten seconds of inhalation , but he needed to be sure .	1
thats what made him who he was .	1
he was the man who made sure .	1
the sight of the female corpses , bloody foam caked around their mouths and noses , already cyanotic , had no effect on him .	1
this was his job , his chosen profession .	1
collateral damage was regrettable , but part of the deal .	1
the girls would have likely been dead within a few years anyway , either at the hands of these goonsor their rivals .	1
it was a fast money life , which didnt come with a retirement plan .	1
breathing through his respirator , the assassin studied the dead cartel boss , then fired a single shot through his forehead , more for effect than anything .	1
he inspected his handiwork dispassionately before reaching into the watertight gun bag for a cell phone and a laminated rectangle .	1
approaching the man , he positioned the card almost tenderly on his exposed throat before snapping a photo with the phone .	1
the figure on the card seemed to watch the proceedings without interest , his medieval regal gaze unblinking in perpetuity , the double-edged blade of his clutched sword forever pointing at the heavens .	1
satisfied with his handiwork , the assassin dropped the phone back into the sack and sealed it before placing it into the web bag hanging from his dive belt .	1
a noise from above jolted him .	1
he heard movement from up on the bridge heavy footsteps that carried down into the mid-ship stateroom , which could signal either a problem or a shift change .	1
the one part of the plan he hadnt been able to nail was a detailed agenda for the security team .	1
there was just nobody he could find that could be paid off , so hed had to wing it .	1
he hoped that wasnt a fatal flaw tonight .	1
hed know soon enough ; even though his work was done , he still needed to complete phase two of the sanction , which was often the hardest part the part where he got out alive .	1
alberto called his men to an area near the dock and briefed the new arrivals .	1
they would be on shift until four-twenty , at which point theyd be relieved by a new , fresh set of eight .	1
the men handed the replacements their weapons and spare clips , then moved in a group toward the hotel , a wing of which had been booked for the security detail and boat staff .	1
alberto debated going with them , having already been on for eight hours , but he couldnt eradicate the twisting in his stomach that something was amiss , so he knew there was no way hed be able to sleep .	1
he held up a pair of night vision goggles and studied the rocks of the jetty that protected the harbor , slowly and carefully scanning every foot of them .	1
nothing .	1
a cry from the bridge interrupted his reconnaissance , and he looked up to where one of the new arrivals was waving .	1
what an idiot .	1
why didnt he use the radio ?	1
thats what they were for .	1
alberto turned the volume up on his handheld and called to the man .	1
what is it ?	1
iwas papi or any of the girls swimming earlier today or this evening ?	1
ive been gone for eight hours .	1
no .	1
i dont think so .	1
why ?	1
alberto asked , honestly puzzled by the question .	1
theres a pair of without warning the radio went dead .	1
the hair on albertos arms stood up as he peered through the goggles up at the bridge .	1
he couldnt see either of the men who were stationed there as sentries .	1
bridge .	1
come in .	1
repeat .	1
come in .	1
do you read me ?	1
alberto hissed into the radio , his hopes sinking even as he called .	1
the body of one of the two guards sailed over the side of the bridge , landing in a formless mass four stories below on the concrete surface of the dock near albertos feet .	1
alberto stared at the body in disbelief , a stain of thick , dark blood quickly pooling around the corpse .	1
moments later a second corpse hurtled over the security men all rushed toward the yacht , now in full-scale attack mode .	1
the two men on the bridge had been in unassailable positions , with the only access from the rear deckand the salon , where papi had last been seen leading his friends below to his palatial zebra wood-paneled stateroom .	1
the night abruptly exploded into an inferno , temporarily blinding alberto .	1
from inside the boat , the whump of an incendiary grenade illuminated the interior with a white-hot flash before the ensuing blaze erupted from the side windows , shattered from the scorching blast .	1
a figure in black wearing scuba gear swung from the bridge over the waterside of the ship , dropping the forty feet into the harbor even as alberto hazily trained his weapon on him and opened fire with a hail of bullets .	1
burst after burst of sizzling lead seared into the water where the diver had submerged , and albertos men quickly joined him , shooting point blank into the surface in the hopes of hitting something .	1
the assassin allowed himself to sink to the bottom , twenty-five feet below the surface .	1
he kicked a few feet and took cover beneath the gargantuan hull , the bullets tearing harmlessly through the deep where he would have been if he was stupid enough to try to swim out of the harbors mouth .	1
hed give it a few minutes and let the gunmen exhaust their wrath before doing so he still had sufficient air .	1
even the most dedicated mercenaries would tire of emptying weapons into the bay for no reason , so it would only be a few more moments before they stopped and began thinking about evacuating before the military arrived to check on the blaze .	1
it would be a long slog across the bay without the swim fins hed been forced to leave on the aft deck .	1
that was regrettable .	1
he made a mental note in the future to bring an extra set with him to attach to the hull , where they would be safely waiting for him if he was forced to make a hasty departure .	1
he checked his watch and peered through the gloom at his regulator gauge , which he illuminated using the dim glow from the gps .	1
he had forty-five percent left , which would get him out of the harbor and at least halfway across the bay before he needed to jettison the tank and switch to using his snorkel .	1
with any luck at all he would be on the far side , on the banks of the little fishing hamlet of barra de navidad , within an hour and fifteen minutes , where a battered toyota tacoma sat waiting on a dark , deserted street by the water .	1
it would be the least-expected escape route given it was the farthest point from the ship .	1
if the security detail still had any fight left in them after losing their meal ticket , theyd deploy to the more obvious areas closer to the yacht , although any pursuit would be hurried due to concerns over the arrival of the marines .	1
the odds of there being any serious hunt for him were about zero , he knew .	1
theyd be far more interested in clearing out before they had to explain their heavily armed presence to the military .	1
from the town of barra , he could be in manzanillo within forty minutes , or better yet , at one of the big hotels just north of town .	1
they were showing their age , but he still liked las hadras resort as a place to lay low for a few days while waiting for the wire transfer to hit his account .	1
when he got to shore he would e-mail the photo of papi , with his distinctive calling card in glorious display , using his cell phones internet capability .	1
the client would be suitably impressed , given yet another impossible execution in his notorious string of accomplishments had gone off without a hitch .	1
the gas had been a novel touch and hed been delighted with the results .	1
it was short-duration and would have blown off within five minutes of entering the air-filtration and conditioning system , so the only trace any investigators would find would be the empty canisters wedged into the hull .	1
at that stage it would be pretty obvious that something in the atmosphere had killed the passengers , so the discovery would have zero effect on anything .	1
the vendor had done well with the choice ; the assassin grinned behind the heavy glass mask hed use him again .	1
reliability in the assassins game was key to sustaining rewarding long-term relationships .	1
rousing himself from his reverie , he began swimming slowly away from the boat , hugging the bottom so as to avoid any telltales to the flashlight beams playing across the surface .	1
they were wasting their time but he wanted to take no further chances .	1
he resolved to hold his breath for the two minutes it would take to make it to the harbor entrance and to safety there was no point in increasing the odds of more shooting by leaving an unnecessary bubble trail up top if he didnt have to .	1
by the time the flames were extinguished there was little left of the ships upper salon or staterooms , other than the main bedroom used by the owner .	1
when alberto made his way down the shattered stairs to the companionway that led to that area , he already knew in his heart what his eyes would confirm .	1
his boss , his sacred charge , was dead .	1
still , nothing could have prepared him for the vision of a naked papi with the tarot card sticking out of his bloody , froth-caked mouth , surrounded by the cold-blue naked flesh of his nubile companions who had obviously died in excruciating agony .	1
his blood ran cold when he saw the image of the seated regent protruding from papis face .	1
hed heard the stories , the rumors of the ghost that came to kill , but had never believed they were true .	1
until now .	1
until hed witnessed the handiwork with his own eyes the handiwork of the king of swords , or el rey as he was known in mexico .	1
he was every heavily protected targets worst nightmare the man who could walk through walls or up the sides of buildings , and from whom no one was safe .	1
seeing the assassins calling card was a loss of any innocence or hope hed ever had .	1
because now , alberto knew that there was indeed a boogeyman , a devil that danced in the darkness , a stealer of things precious for delivery to hell .	1
alberto could say with assurance that there was something that scared him more than the mexican marines , more than torture , more than the prospect of death itself .	1
he , a man for whom slaughter and killing was mundane , had seen the face of true evil , and it had stared back at him , unflinching .	1
el rey had come during the night and stolen papis soul .	1
chapter 2 twenty-five years ago , sinaloa , mexico the flames leapt up into the night sky , their eerie flickering the only evidence that anything man-made had existed in the deserted field of marijuana plants .	1
the shacks were ablaze , sending embers shooting into the air as they carried the captives hopes of survival to heaven with them .	1
the little girl sobbed , terrified of what was to come .	1
her mother , helpless beside her , howled an incoherent , primal sound into the ground next to the mutilated corpse of her youngest , while futilely struggling against the crude plastic ties that bound her bloody wrists .	1
this had been the worst night in the toddlers short , harsh life , and it seemed surreal to her .	1
she hoped it was a nightmare .	1
the dead form of her father lay sprawled next to her mother , his life extinguished in an unspeakable manner .	1
she didnt understand any of it .	1
she wanted to live .	1
she had so much to do her life was just starting .	1
true , it had been a difficult existence so far , as the daughter of a dirt-poor farmer in the hills of rural mexico ; another mouth to feed in a hard environment where money was non-existent and the family lived off the land .	1
but , as with most children , she loved her parents wholeheartedly , no matter what the circumstance ; they were her universe and she had just begun viewing the world as a thing apart from them .	1
as the seasons came and went , the familys time was spent working their meager patch of land : a plot of several acres that had been in the family for over a century .	1
they survived without any creature comforts , their power provided by an ancient gas-powered generator which was used only in emergencies gasoline being far too precious a commodity to waste on luxuries such as lights .	1
there was no plumbing ; their water came from an artesian well .	1
still , it was a life , her life , and the only one shed known in her four years on the planet and like most organisms , she wanted it to continue as long as possible .	1
then the unthinkable had happened .	1
the men had arrived in their huge truck , and soon the shack the little family called home was ablaze and her sister and father were no longer of this world .	1
and now she kneeled , crying while she murmured the only prayer she knew , hoping it would work as a talisman to keep the bad men at bay .	1
our father , who arth in heaven , she lisped in a soft , tremulous tone .	1
she swiveled her head and watched as an older man , who had just arrived after their field had been set alight , walked slowly back to his vehicle holding the hand of a young boy her brother .	1
one of the remaining two men moved beside her and grabbed her mothers hair , lifting her to her knees , her grief shrieking in gasping sobs even as she trembled in shock and fear .	1
her shoulders shook the shabby sleeves of her torn peasant dress , now bloody and filthy from the abuse shed received at the hands of the animals who stood by them with their pistols and cowboy boots .	1
a gunshot rang out , deafening the little girl her mother fell forward onto the bloody dirt , her suffering ended , gone to join her husband and baby .	1
the little girl cried to the silent god who had abandoned her , an innocent , even as she continued to recite the words shed been assured would protect her through anything .	1
thy king done come she closed her eyes against the horror of the scene and imagined a place where she would be forever young , playing in a beautiful grass field with puppies and ponies ; her father , young , healthy and vibrant running beside her as her mother tossed her baby sister into the air , eliciting squeals of glee from the delighted tike .	1
she sensed the cold menace of the gun barrel against the back of her tiny head , and redoubled her efforts to send her maidez to her creator .	1
thy will be the lead ripped through her cerebrum , abruptly terminating her brief sojourn on earth .	1
her frail body tumbled lifelessly to the ground .	1
for her , the ordeal was over .	1
the men watched as the cannabis caught fire , fed by the gasoline that had been so frugally saved for the familys power , their butchery merely another days work in their brutal world of enforcement of their absolute power .	1
both would sleep well that night , their consciences long ago having been discarded as impediments to their working for the group that would later become the sinaloa cartel the most powerful and ruthless of the mexican narcotraficantes .	1
the nights drama had been another in a long line of horrors theyd inflicted on their fellow men in order to solidify their jefes control over the region .	1
the citizenry only understood and respected one thing , and that was brute force .	1
they were the delivery system for that primal justice , and they knew that nobody would ever miss the peasant family or question the events of that night .	1
it was all business as usual ; nobody wanted to have the men visit their home if they were too inquisitive about what had happened or where the farmer and his family had gone .	1
the events would remain just another footnote in the slaughter that was an ongoing part of the drug traffic in mexico .	1
there was nobody to defend the innocents , and so they perished , as countless others had before them in brutal episodes that determined nothing .	1
mexicos soil was steeped in the blood of the helpless the men knew that nobody would mourn them .	1
they had no power , no clout , and so were disposable .	1
the enforcers returned to their truck , which started with a roar , and they tore off into the night , down the dirt track that led to civilization , such as it was .	1
~ ~ ~ twenty years ago , sinaloa , mexico horses whinnied as they galloped around the periphery of the open field .	1
the men gathered in the center whistling at the ponies as they celebrated their temporary equestrian freedom .	1
a sprawling mission-style hacienda sat imposingly in the distance easily twenty-thousand feet of interior space built on a bluff overlooking a river which burbled softly below it as it carried fresh water from the mountains , so vital for the irrigation of the regions crops , which were mainly tomatoes and marijuana .	1
the majority of the cannabis grown in mexico came from sinaloa , and it had been this harvest that had been instrumental in the creation of the modern cartel system .	1
originally , only a few families engaged in the trafficking of marijuana to the u.s. , along with heroin of moderate quality and purity produced in modest , local fields .	1
it had been a small business , operated like a cottage industry , tightly held with a minimum of violence other than turf wars over growing and distribution rights .	1
then , in the late 1970s , the dynamics had shifted ; the smuggling networks that had been engaged in this relatively benign trade took on the burden of moving cocaine through mexico for the colombian cartels , and then the money got much bigger as the cali and medellin cartels grew increasingly reliant on their mexican smugglers to get the product to the u.s .	1
this naturally led to a situation where the mexicans began getting paid in product , versus cash , driving them to become distributors , as opposed to transporters and the money involved took another quantum jump .	1
by the early 1990s , the mexican cartels were handling much of the trafficking for the colombians , whose cartels had disintegrated in the late 1980s with their survivors now focused mainly on manufacturing .	1
within a little over a decade , a small business had become a multi-billion-dollar industry and the various factions fought it out for the rights to their geographical areas .	1
by 1990 , the sinaloa cartel was the most powerful in all mexico in all the world , in fact primarily because the godfather of the mexican drug trade , miguel angel flix gallardo , was from culiacan , the capital of sinaloa .	1
it was he who ran a hundred percent of the trade through mexico during the seventies and eighties , and he who had the relationships with the colombians .	1
in the mid-eighties , he decided to divide up mexico into regions , so the power that was naturally concentrated in sinaloa remained there , with the other cartels acting as satellites to that main central group .	1
that changed when gallardo went to prison in the late eighties , which created a vacuum in the leadership and opened the door for the smaller , less important cartels to assert a better foothold .	1
in particular , the tijuana cartel and the juarez cartel had jockeyed for greater sway and a larger chunk of the profits , leading to often bloody wars with their sinaloa brethren .	1
the group of men watching the horses laughed easily together , cans of tecate tempering the worst of the mid-day heat .	1
it was fall , the storm season was largely over , but the temperatures could still reach the high nineties during the day , bringing with it substantial humidity .	1
the oldest of the men , don miguel lopez , a tall , lean man with the leathery complexion that came from a lifetime outdoors , had his left hand resting on the shoulder of a ten-year-old boy , already lanky from the summers growth spurt that had left him all arms and legs , an alien in an unfamiliar body .	1
it was his birthday and , at ten , it was time for him to begin learning the skills hed require to survive in an ever-competitive world .	1
in mexico , with a head of the household who was one of the original ranking members of the sinaloa cartel , that translated into more than reading , writing and arithmetic .	1
don miguel , the elder statesman of the group , smoothed his mustache and lifted his cowboy hat , wiping away the sweat from his brow with a soiled red cloth handkerchief he carried for that purpose , and then patted the boys shoulder .	1
its time for you to learn about the way of the world .	1
as part of your birthday , im handing you over to emilio here , who will teach you everything youll need to know about maintaining a healthy body and mind , as well as about horses and weapons .	1
and who knows ; maybe when youre older , he can even teach you a thing or two about women , don miguel joked .	1
the surrounding men obligingly laughed at his playful sense of fun .	1
my business will be demanding an increasing amount of my time and ill be traveling much of the year , so im entrusting you to emilios capable hands .	1
youre to treat him with the same respect you would afford me .	1
are we clear on that ?	1
hes your mentor , which is a position of honor , but its also one of responsibility , and if you fail to apply yourself it will reflect poorly on him .	1
the boy nodded his understanding .	1
he didnt talk much had never seen much point to it .	1
even at his tender age hed discovered that it wasnt what people said , it was what they did that counted , so engaging in what he viewed as meaningless banter served no purpose .	1
he looked up at emilios wizened face , battered by the cruel vagaries of a fickle universe , and fixed the man with his gaze remarkable in its intensity , especially given that he was just a boy .	1
emilio regarded him and then grunted , gesturing with his head for the boy to follow him .	1
the pair walked toward the stables and , once out of view of the men , emilio got down on one knee so as better to get his point across .	1
my job is to make you a man .	1
i know your history , and im here to tell you nothing matters but the present and the future .	1
where youve been ?	1
thats meaningless .	1
nobody cares .	1
the only reason the past matters is so you can learn from it .	1
thats the whole reason making mistakes and surviving them matters .	1
experience is what we call the mistakes we survive .	1
emilio grinned , and tussled the boys hair .	1
and ive got a lot of experience .	1
so youre going to stick with me , eh ?	1
every day , before you go to school , we will spend an hour together learning how to discipline your body .	1
every afternoon after school , youll spend three hours with me , learning how to discipline your mind .	1
once you have both under total control , well proceed to the fun stuff learning how to shoot , ride , swim , hunt , and how to stay hidden .	1
but i cant teach you anything until you have control over yourself .	1
the boy glared at him dubiously , his dislike of the situation and his new mentor obvious .	1
emilio swatted him on the side of the head , just enough to get his attention .	1
you see ?	1
you dont have control .	1
you cant hide your emotions , so youre an open book to anyone who wants to read you .	1
you dont like me , and its obvious so i now have power over you .	1
youve given me that power by failing to contain your feelings , and i can use it to hurt you .	1
so your first lesson is to control your emotions .	1
if not , theyll control you , and youll be blown around like a leaf , always reacting to whatever storm is taking place in your brain .	1
even at ten years old , the boy had learned to listen .	1
emilio could see the wheels turning in his small head as he absorbed what the older man had said .	1
it doesnt matter to me whether we do this the easy way or the hard way .	1
either will work .	1
if youre interested in proving youre stubborn , save your energy for something that matters .	1
you want to prove something , show me youre determined ; youll have plenty of chances .	1
my job is to build you into a leader , a man others will look up to , who makes smart decisions with a level head , and who never , ever loses his cool .	1
youll soon figure out that its better to put some effort into learning what im teaching rather than fighting it .	1
in the end , resisting the lessons will just be delaying the inevitable , which is getting to the fun parts .	1
so decide .	1
make a choice , then eliminate all other possible outcomes .	1
that will be your road .	1
i hope you select a good one , emilio concluded , and then opened the barn door and moved inside to the bales of hay .	1
he studied the pile and motioned with his hand to the old pitchfork leaning against the far wall .	1
happy birthday .	1
starting today , and every day until i tell you that you can stop , i want you to move the hay from these bales , over to this pile by the feeding trough .	1
spend one hour per day doing it , every morning before school .	1
emilio glanced at the boy , who now regarded him impassively .	1
the old man reached into his pocket , and produced a new stainless steel wrist watch , tearing off the tags as he examined the clasp .	1
he looked at the time and then tossed it to the boy , who snatched it out of the air with ease .	1
thats my birthday gift to you .	1
its always important to give , in order to get .	1
i see youre right-handed by your catch .	1
that can be a liability over time .	1
well work together so that you can do any task with either hand , equally comfortably .	1
if youre ever wounded in one arm , you can use the other , and that edge could be the difference between you living or dying on the floor .	1
everything i do has a reason .	1
but for now , start on the hay .	1
do you know how to read a clock ?	1
how to tell time on that watch ?	1
the boy nodded his head in the affirmative .	1
another lesson .	1
never tell me you know something if you dont .	1
i dont mind it if you dont know not knowing if you havent been shown isnt your fault .	1
not knowing because you werent shown because you pretended to knowthats stupidity , emilio cautioned .	1
i know how to tell time ; how to read a clock .	1
im not stupid , the boy declared angrily .	1
ah , so he speaks .	1
very good .	1
but you still havent learned my first lesson .	1
by showing me how youre feeling , either with your voice , or eyes , or body , youre giving me an advantage over you .	1
and i can use that to destroy you .	1
so well work on you learning to control your emotions , to be cool and collected at all times .	1
its the first lesson ill teach you , and probably the single most valuable .	1
emilio studied the boys features , the dark brown eyes radiating a quiet intensity .	1
once you master the ability to manage your inner domain , you will have power over others , instead of them having power over you .	1
learning to do so is a matter of practice .	1
the more you practice , the more composed youll become , and the faster youll progress .	1
its not just about hiding your emotions from others its about arresting your state .	1
if you lose control , you lose .	1
its that simple .	1
if nothing else , always remember that .	1
you lose .	1
emilio glanced at the pitchfork , then back at the boy .	1
and something tells me you dont like losing , eh ?	1
well , heres another piece of experience from a lifetime of mistakes : winning takes work usually a lot of it .	1
and practice .	1
and commitment .	1
which is where i come in .	1
so , happy birthday , treat your watch with care and it will function well for many years and get to the hay its not going to move itself .	1
emilio turned and strode out of the building and onto the dirt riding path , leaving the boy to his thoughts .	1
emilio could tell he was one tough little bastard , that was for sure .	1
it wouldnt be easy reining him in .	1
it was the same with the horses .	1
you had to break their spirits sufficiently so that they could learn how to behave in a productive manner , but not crush them entirely you wanted a thoroughbred that desired to winor it became a plow horse .	1
don miguel was a smart man , and he had been clear that he expected the boy groomed to be a suitable heir to his rapidly expanding fortune .	1
the next five or six years would be the ones that forged the boys character and made him into whatever he would ultimately be .	1
tough was good .	1
so was stubborn .	1
and smart .	1
don miguel had stressed how intelligent the boy was , devouring every book he could get his hands on .	1
that could be a powerful combination of character traits .	1
emilio would steer him in a direction where he had an outlet for his obvious simmering anger .	1
the don didnt have time to raise him and teach him what hed need to know .	1
every day brought more and more threats to the dons survival ; the truth was , he would be in hiding much of the time , directing his affairs from a safe distance .	1
don miguel was now a major player in the mexican trafficking scheme , but with the spoils came the risks .	1
there was a constant and never-ending supply of enemies who would cut his throat for the slightest advantage .	1
the danger was very real and immediate .	1
so he would leave his beloved estancia , his horses , and become a general in the ongoing war , coming home only for brief visits when he deemed it to be safe .	1
it was an unforgiving existence that could end at any moment , but it was the life hed chosen , and now he ran things in much of northern sinaloa he was becoming a fabulously wealthy man , even by cartel standards .	1
in the dons business , there was no retiring , no quitting to pursue other interests .	1
the trade operated according to the law of the jungle : you kept killing until something killed you .	1
if you were the meanest and smartest predator , perhaps youd have a long life .	1
so far , don miguel had proved to be up to every challenge .	1
that could change in a blink , but emilio didnt think so .	1
he was one in a million ; easily a genius , as well as utterly ruthless and clinically calculating .	1
that combination of traits was rare , especially in a business that boasted more testosterone than a boxing club .	1
but the don was also looking to the future .	1
he realized that the boy would always be a target , no matter what pursuit he chose as an adult .	1
which meant that he needed to be equipped with skills that would enable him to survive in a world filled with enemies .	1
even if he didnt become a predator himself , he would need to learn the lessons that would keep him from showing his soft underbelly to those that would cheerfully rip out his entrails .	1
emilio was the boys best shot at survival .	1
he would teach him the lessons he would need to learn well in order to stay alive , and hopefully to flourish .	1
he would make the boy into a man .	1
starting today .	1
chapter 3 sixteen years ago , sinaloa , mexico the boy had grown considerably over the thousand days since emilio had taken over his care , and had mastered all of the tasks hed been assigned .	1
he was remarkably self-possessed , excelled in his studies , and had worked diligently on his exercises .	1
emilio had transitioned him from hay to a real workout , in order to keep up with his rapidly developing physique .	1
his upper body was sculpted by a series of isometric exercises , culminating in chin-ups and push-ups ; his lower body was conditioned with increasingly longer runs .	1
even as he approached his fourteenth birthday , he could easily be mistaken for two years older and his gait had taken on the measured confidence of an athlete .	1
don miguel had occasionally stopped by and each time hed been surprised by the boys development .	1
gone for six months at a time , it seemed that with each visit , the boy was a few inches taller and sporting a few more pounds of muscle .	1
don miguel was pleased with the metamorphosis and indicated his satisfaction with generous increases in the boys allowance , as well as in emilios remuneration .	1
the boy was now easily half of emilios workload because the number of skills to be learned increased with his age .	1
he was already an accomplished horseback rider and swimmer , and had shown considerable aptitude for archery .	1
it wasnt unusual for the boy to spend hours each day patiently firing at targets with his hunting bow , gradually increasing the distance as he mastered a given range .	1
that was how he approached things methodically , analytically .	1
hed quickly taken emilios counsel to heart and worked at controlling his emotions no matter what the stimuli .	1
emilio had taught him any number of tricks to help him remain detached and calm in any situation .	1
on his fourteenth birthday , don miguel was nowhere to be found , but had sent a substantial financial stipend to be lavished on the boys newest tier of training weapons .	1
emilio had received instructions to teach him to become proficient with handguns and rifles , and had sourced a variety of guns of all shapes and sizes .	1
by this point , he knew the boy would practice until he excelled at whatever the challenge was and he wasnt disappointed with his firearms progress .	1
within a year , the boy was a crack shot with any weapon you handed him , firing either right or left handed .	1
hed become ambidextrous through discipline and application , and spent three to four hours every afternoon at the private shooting range emilio and he had constructed for his use .	1
firearms were illegal in mexico , but out in the country , with no neighbors for miles and with all the local police on the payroll , nobody seemed to mind the constant volleys of shots that echoed through the trees for hours on end .	1
nobody was being hurt , no harm was done and everyone was getting bountiful christmas bonuses each year , so there was no reason to rock any boats .	1
it was live and let live as far as law enforcement was concerned , which worked out in everyones best interests .	1
the boy quickly grew comfortable with any guns provided to him .	1
as his fourteenth year transitioned into his fifteenth , he was exceeding all expectations emilio had of him .	1
one afternoon , shortly after the boys fifteenth birthday , emilio performed the ultimate pistol test , bringing with him a smith and wesson .357 magnum revolver and a ruger 9mm semi-automatic .	1
he set up two coffee cans thirty yards away from each other , paced off forty yards with the boy and held out both handguns .	1
the target on the left , shoot with your left hand using the revolver .	1
the one on the right , use the ruger .	1
fire as quickly as you can while maintaining accuracy , emilio instructed .	1
the boy hefted both pistols , getting a feel for their weight .	1
he knew from hundreds of hours of experience that firing a big bore revolver required different skills than a smaller caliber automatic .	1
besides the difference in recoil , which was considerable and had to be adjusted for , a revolver used each trigger pull to rotate the cylinder that held the bullets , requiring significantly more pressure and causing a reflex that would make most shooters fire high , pulling up from the target .	1
firing a revolver with both hands in a military crouch was hard enough , but doing so with his weak hand while adjusting for the low recoil of the ruger was an almost impossible challenge .	1
how many pounds of trigger pressure on the ruger ?	1
the boy asked .	1
i wonder , if youre in a situation where you have to use someone elses weapon , whether theyll be able to answer that for you ?	1
my guess is , not , emilio replied .	1
the boy shrugged .	1
never hurt to ask .	1
he calculated the distance and then began firing , alternating weapons , rapidly , but not in an uncontrolled manner .	1
the pair of cans , which theyd filled with water , sprouted leaks .	1
after emptying both weapons in their direction they walked over to inspect the results .	1
of six possible hits from the revolver , five had found their mark .	1
all nine that emilio had loaded the ruger with found theirs .	1
heh .	1
not bad .	1
i would have guessed you wouldnt have hit any with the revolver .	1
the only problem is that the one you didnt hit it with might have been the one you needed to save your life .	1
well need to practice this more , switch things up on you .	1
and i want to start practicing shooting while running or riding in a vehicle soon .	1
once you master being able to hit anything using whatever youre handed from a still position , well kick it up a notch and have you simulate real combat situations where youre not stationary .	1
this was high praise from emilio , who was grudging with his accolades .	1
the boy smiled .	1
he understood his performance was extraordinary .	1
nobody he knew could have done it .	1
but emilio was right .	1
there was no room for error , and no satisfaction to be had from being almost great .	1
emilios only concern as the boy matured was the inevitable interest that he showed toward his daughter , jasmine .	1
she was a year younger than the boy but already a beauty , thankfully reflecting her mothers genes rather than emilios .	1
also highly intelligent , she was every bit the boys match when it came to anything intellectual , and there had been a simmering kind of sibling rivalry between them since theyd first met .	1
jasmines mother had died when she was five , leaving emilio to shoulder the burden of raising her , assisted by his sister and mother .	1
one of the benefits of being a breadwinner of secure means with a generous employer like don miguel was that you could help support family members , and emilio did his fair share .	1
in return for which , the ladies , as he called them , raised jasmine while he was working .	1
it wasnt a perfect situation but it had done well enough by her and shed blossomed into a gorgeous , charming example of classical mexican beauty , all gleaming black hair , white teeth and coffee-kissed skin .	1
the only quirk shed shown was a deep interest in the occult , driven no doubt by a frustrated desire to somehow relate to her departed mother .	1
she was catholic , of course , as was everyone in sinaloa they knew , but shed grown restive with the faith and had taken to reading tomes of dubious virtue , on divining , and psychic powers , levitation and transmutation , and all manner of arcane , esoteric disciplines .	1
jasmine had of late been sneaking out and spending time with an old woman who claimed to read fortunes in ones palm , as well as through studying tea leaves all for a price , of course .	1
emilio had been worried , but the ladies had assured him that it was just a phase ; a way to appear more mysterious as she came of age .	1
hed never understood women , having found them all equally inscrutable and impossible to read , so in the end hed decided to take the advice of his mother and sister and let the fascination run its course .	1
emilios days consisted of working with the boy and the horses .	1
once both children were home from school , his attention focused almost exclusively on the boy , leaving jasmine to be trained by the ladies in the feminine ways of the world .	1
this wasnt because of any lack of love on emilios part .	1
on the contrary , he lived for jasmine .	1
it was just that as shed grown from a child into an adolescent hed felt out of his depth , and now that she was thirteen , and moody , her body sprouting the curves that would attract members of the opposite sex like bees to honey , he had no idea how to deal with her .	1
he rationalized that this was natural , and would hopefully also pass .	1
she just needed to be around other women , to learn whatever it was they learned while he taught the boy how to do masculine things .	1
one friday before easter , the boy had come home from school with a bloody nose and some abrasions on his face , which after some hard questioning turned out had come about from a fight with an older bully who had been bothering jasmine during recess ; he had grown increasingly abusive and insulting as the day had worn on .	1
the boy had rushed to defend jasmines honor , only to be pummeled by the larger student , whose two years of seniority was enhanced by growing up in a household with three brothers who had taught him to fight .	1
the boys education hadnt yet moved to manual self-defense , but , looking at his bruised face , emilio decided it was time to teach him how to use his fists .	1
as with most things , the boy learned quickly and , within a few weeks , had mastered the basics of the primitive form of martial arts emilio knew ; really just a combination of rudimentary boxing and street-fighting techniques .	1
but the boy was a sponge , and once hed exhausted emilios capabilities he lobbied for more advanced training and given that it was emilios job to provide him with the fullest possible education , they researched alternatives and quickly found a plethora of options .	1
culiacan was the nearest large city , a half hour drive from the ranch .	1
it had a number of martial arts schools specializing in judo , karate , and kung fu .	1
the boy convinced emilio that his development warranted three classes a week .	1
he added the stylized moves and holds he learned to his exercise routine , striving to perfect those as he had so many others .	1
there were no more incidents at school after the next altercation when the boy knocked the older punk unconscious within a few seconds of the fight starting , the bully abruptly lost his taste for hassling jasmine or picking on either of them .	1
his classmates treated him with polite and cautious deference from that point on .	1
he didnt mix with the rest of his peers and showed no interest in friendships beyond casual greetings-in-passing in the halls .	1
that was more than enough interaction for him ; he viewed his fellow students as inferior in every way not because he was arrogant , but rather because hed run an equation and found them wanting and immature .	1
they were children , given to excitement or emotional flights , whereas he was almost an adult , always restrained .	1
he was quiet and withdrawn and tended to keep to himself , preferring to limit his mingling to jasmine during recess .	1
they had grown close by virtue of their shared male authority figure .	1
it was a brother-sister relationship , for the most part , but the ladies had cautioned both emilio and jasmine that things would have to change once they both matured .	1
shortly after he turned sixteen and she fifteen the inevitable occurred ; the two became inseparable in spite of admonitions from the adults .	1
jasmine was gorgeous by then , and at an age when many mexican girls in past generations were married and having their first children , so it was foolish high hope on everyones part to expect that the two wouldnt find each other , living out in the country as they did , and in the same compound .	1
the boy had grown from a gangly colt into a self-possessed young man with looks that made females glance at him twice , and jasmine radiated a beauty that was dazzling to behold .	1
one afternoon after school they had been hanging around the corral , the heat of the approaching summer heavy in the air , and the boy and jasmine had spied each other across the field and gravitated to the fence , the horses within the enclosure prancing as they trotted around and around , two ranch hands minding them with watchful eyes .	1
so , what are you up to ?	1
jasmine asked , her furtive glance taking in the boys glistening chest , a thin sheen of perspiration lingering from his afternoon workout .	1
nothing .	1
same as ever .	1
last days of school for the year , and constant practice with your father .	1
ah , yes , the practice .	1
thats got to get old after a while , she said , offering a gleaming smile .	1
everything gets old after a while , the boy said , his voice sounding more mature than his years , the timbre having changed that spring from the higher pitch of an adolescent .	1
she took a sidelong glance at him and noticed that hed begun shaving recently , his upper lip darkened by a dusting of stubble , and something in her lurched at the sight of his chiseled profile .	1
they watched the horses , and then a third ranchero approached leading a large brown stallion , the proud creature tossing its head side to side as it trailed the man .	1
the other two ranchers drove the remaining ponies out of the corral and towards the barn , the way familiar to them from countless days of training , leaving only one tan mare , still frisky with the energy of youth .	1
a fourth cowboy entered the corral , and clicking his tongue , moved to the mare and quieted her , feeding her sugar as he murmured in her ear and stroked her head , her flanks quivering from her earlier exertions .	1
jasmine sucked in her breath as the stallion was taken to the mare , and her complexion flushed as the stallion mounted the female and the two horses mated a not uncommon occurrence on the ranch , but one that had increasingly drawn her interest of late .	1
the boy eyed the proceedings with marginal interest , his attention drawn more by jasmines smooth skin and flashing eyes than anything equestrian-related .	1
when the show was over , electricity seemed to crackle between jasmine and the boy , unspoken but as powerful as a lightning strike .	1
come on .	1
i want to show you something , jasmine said , her voice tight as she brushed back her glossy black hair with slender fingers , revealing a perfectly sculpted neckline and delicately formed ears , wisps of black curls framing each , small gold studs catching the sun .	1
the boy nodded , swallowing hard , his mouth suddenly dry , and they walked to the edge of the clearing and then into the heavy woods surrounding the ranch .	1
where are you going ?	1
he asked , but she didnt answer with anything but a shush as she led the way .	1
eventually they reached a stream they had both spent many summers enjoying , its cool clear water flowed down from the nearby mountains , the rushing of the current over the time-worn rocks musical to their ears .	1
the heat of the day had built to the low-nineties , muggy before an approaching storm , and the change in the atmosphere near the water was palpable .	1
i just wanted to get away for a while .	1
its so damned hot at the house , and theres nothing to do .	1
im bored , she complained , her lips flashing the hint of a smile as she took in the stream .	1
how about you ?	1
dont you get tired , every day the same thing , never anything new ?	1
its driving me crazy he moved to the edge of the bank and picked up a small flat stone , then tossed it into the swirling current .	1
sure .	1
who wouldnt ?	1
he admitted , and then they both fell silent , contemplating the streams gentle surge .	1
jasmine sat down near the water and then lay back on the grass , considering the configuration of the sparse , puffy clouds overhead as though they held some sort of secret .	1
she shifted her gaze to his face , and when she caught his eye the boy sat next to her , another rock in his hand , his repertoire of small talk exhausted .	1
hed always been easy in her presence , a familiarity bred from years of proximity , but now , suddenly , everything felt different , and he couldnt think of anything to say .	1
a warm breeze stirred the surrounding trees , and for a moment , time stood still , the perfection of the instant lingering as though it could last forever .	1
jasmine rolled towards him and reached up with a trembling hand , then pulled him down to her , no words required .	1
he hesitated for a brief instant and then he was lying next to her , her scent vaguely floral , as inviting as anything hed ever dreamt of .	1
his lips found hers and his eyes closed even as hers remained open , a faraway look in them neither would have recognized .	1
the boys tentative gentleness gradually shifted to a more aggressive confidence , and soon an urgency was building in him that dictated its own pace .	1
her rhythm matched his , a new , unfamiliar hunger now in control of her , a need that had been little more than a smolder suddenly flaring up to become an out-of-control blaze .	1
they were both breathless when she pushed him away and sat up , seeming to arrive at an important decision as his awareness returned to the present from whatever miraculous destination hed found in her arms .	1
she rose , his puzzled gaze trailing her as she peered at the water , then fixed him with a playful look as she smoothed her dress , her hands lingering on the white cotton a little longer than normal .	1
im hot .	1
lets cool off , she said , and then , surprising him as much as anything ever had , jasmine pulled the light summer dress over her head and kicked off her sandals , her perfect youthful curves clad in only a straining bra and a pair of pink cotton panties .	1
the boy was speechless at the nearly naked immediacy of her nubile body , but before he could regain his composure she had turned from him and slipped her bra off , then taken a tentative step into the water , and then another , the sight of her tan skin and flawless back mesmerizing until she was immersed to her neck in a deep pool ten yards upstream .	1
come on .	1
its wonderful , she invited , and he glanced down at his shirt and pants , the evidence of his arousal obvious .	1
he grinned and shrugged , then stripped off his shirt , the hardened slabs of muscle chiseled from his relentless exercise regimen riveting jasmines gaze as he stepped out of his shoes , and then he pulled off his jeans and tossed them on top of her dress .	1
when he made it to jasmine , in the pool where they had taken their refreshment countless times as children , she welcomed him in a decidedly more mature way , her legs wrapping around his waist as she kissed him again , this time deeper , a low moan escaping from her recesses as their lips and tongues met , and for a fleeting moment he felt like he ruled the world , was capable of anything , a man , now , finally , who had found his elusive meaning in life .	1
the day passed in a fog of desire , their appetites finally unleashed , the forbidden secrets of each others bodies now an accessible wonder to be explored .	1
when they returned to the compound three hours later , he first , in order to avoid any suspicion from the staff , followed by jasmine a short time later , both knew something important had forever changed , and no matter what anyone said , they belonged now , and each answered only to the other , the outside world an annoyance that would never understand what theyd shared .	1
the couple found time to sneak away even while under near-constant watch , as young lovers often do , confounding the best intentions of their guardians .	1
theyd spend long hours in each others arms , in the barn , or hidden away in one of the recesses of the main house , or at their original rendezvous spot at the stream .	1
once theyd fully discovered their passion they were like prisoners whod crossed a long , dry desert and found themselves at an oasis .	1
their coupling soon became a daily event and for the first time in his life , the boy found himself enraptured by another human being .	1
his attraction to jasmine was magnetic and primal , and before long he was hers , body and soul , willing to go to any lengths to be with her or make her happy .	1
the boy was even willing to entertain jasmines quirky ideas about the nature of reality , and indulged her penchant for spirituality and the paranormal , which had gradually developed into a borderline obsession .	1
every other utterance from her was regarding what fate , or the stars , wanted , which the boy attributed to her exotic nature and bored intellect .	1
but she was deadly serious about her belief that there was more to the universe than what could be proved or seen , and so it was that three months after his sixteenth birthday he found himself agreeing to accompany her to the lair of an old woman who claimed to be a medium , so she could divine his future .	1
that morning , they set off down the road on their bicycles , followed by a pick-up truck carrying three men wearing cowboy hats and toting assault rifles .	1
even though don miguel was hardly ever in evidence , he insisted that the boy be protected at all times as though an attack on the ranch was imminent .	1
this was just another way in which he was different than his cartel brethren he was a meticulous planner and left nothing to chance .	1
that had stood him in good stead throughout his life ; he was ever-vigilant to possible threats to his family or entourage .	1
when they reached the clapboard hovel where the woman lived and conducted her dubious business , marked with a battered roadside sign ringed with crudely-painted moons and stars proclaiming madame sirena to be a medium extraordinaire , the truck pulled to a stop a discreet distance from the dwelling .	1
the young couple leaned their bicycles against the front of the house and , hand-in-hand , ascended the three rickety steps .	1
jasmine knocked on the door , and flakes of sun-bleached paint dusted her knuckles , the sound of their arrival echoing off the cinderblock walls .	1
after a considerable pause , the weathered door was opened by an ancient gray-haired woman wearing a red gauze gypsy shawl trimmed in small gold coins .	1
she fixed them both with a one-eyed stare the vision in her other eye having been lost long ago .	1
the boy felt momentary revulsion when he saw her milky-white pupil , but hid his reaction and braved a tentative smile .	1
ah .	1
so this is the young man !	1
welcome , jasmine , mi amor .	1
welcome .	1
look at him .	1
hes a strapping one , yes ?	1
handsome , you were right about that , and strong as a bull , id wager .	1
come in , come in , madame sirena insisted , gesturing at the gloomy interior with her claw-like hand .	1
the boy noted in passing that she smelled like hastily applied cheap rose water , and sweat a thoroughly objectionable combination that would stay with him as a reminder of unpleasantness for the rest of his life .	1
here .	1
sit at the table .	1
lets see what we have , eh ?	1
first ill look at your palm , and see what the gods have written for you in terms of love and lifeand then ill do a reading .	1
she peered at them in the gloom , a crafty expression on her wizened face .	1
its customary to leave a tribute for the spirits divine cooperation in producing an accurate reading , young man , she hissed at him , in what he presumed she imagined to be a sly manner .	1
jasmine nudged him with her elbow and the boy fumbled in his pocket and fished out a hundred peso note , placing it in the straw bowl the woman had balanced near the tables edge .	1
the bowl and the money quickly disappeared and then the madame moved around the room , lighting candles and incense .	1
she pushed the button on a portable stereo sitting on a decrepit book shelf ; vaguely-asian music began to drift from the tiny speakers , low volume , atmospheric dissonance to create a mood , more than anything .	1
the boy studied the walls and noted with amusement that there were countless photographs of mediums and sances and spooky-looking scenes , interspersed with turn-of-the-century posters depicting supernatural events and expositions .	1
the overall effect was somewhat clumsy , but effective for the local peasantry , he supposed .	1
what jasmine found so fascinating about it all was beyond him , but if it made her happy , so be it .	1
accepting her fascination without judgment seemed a small enough price to pay to find heaven in her embrace .	1
the crone approached the table and switched on a dusty yellow hanging lamp with an intricate brocade shade that directed most of the light to the center of the table .	1
she sat across from the boy and gestured at him .	1
give me your hand .	1
the right hand .	1
palm up .	1
just relax .	1
this wont hurt .	1
much , she assured him , then cackled .	1
he wondered whether shed gotten her act out of central casting for a c-level horror film , the kind that were popular at the local cinemas with badly dubbed spanish or blurry subtitles .	1
still , he played along , and dutifully placed his hand on the table .	1
the woman took it in hers and made a variety of sounds intended to signal deep thought , no doubt .	1
hmmmm .	1
mmmmyesssss .	1
oh .	1
i see your love line is clear .	1
you will only have one real love in your life , and it will be early in your time here .	1
hmmmm .	1
your lifeline is different .	1
its long , but has many breaks , signaling something unusual .	1
maybe illness , maybe brushes with death .	1
but it continues , so you will prevail through it allhmmmm .	1
this went on for a while and he feigned polite interest in the ambiguous generalities about his possible future .	1
of course , with jasmine sitting there listening , love would be early and intense and genuine , which held an element of truth .	1
when he was with jasmine , he felt like an eagle soaring above the clouds .	1
the intensity of his feelings for her was almost scary .	1
it gave her power over him , which his training advised him to recoil from .	1
still , hormones were not to be denied , and he was smitten , that was for sure .	1
the palm reading finished , the old woman trundled over to a cabinet and withdrew an ancient deck of cards , placing it on the table after shuffling the tattered rectangles for several minutes .	1
this is the tarot .	1
it knows all , and tells all .	1
nobody can hide the truth from the tarot , and its words possess the wisdom of the ages .	1
sure they do .	1
a hundred of my pesos worth , to be exact .	1
including the cheesy canned tunes and the gypsy act .	1
he wished shed get on with it .	1
he could think of a dozen different things hed rather be doing with jasmine just now , all of them involving nudity and not one of them included an old crones hackneyed ramblings .	1
the woman began her ritual , and paused at the end after shed revealed all the cards .	1
the boy was absently studying the photos on the stained wall behind her , his attention caught by a photograph of a raven , or perhaps a crow , perched on a barbed-wire fence .	1
something about it chilled his blood , but he didnt know why .	1
hed tuned out her prattle as his gaze had roamed over the images , thinking thoughts worthy of his energy rather than listening to superstitious mumbo-jumbo .	1
his awareness grudgingly returned to the table , pulled from the photo of the crow , as the putative madame contemplated the meaning of the cards .	1
she pointed at several with a trembling finger .	1
this is death .	1
its placement in the reading is ominous .	1
it can signal many things , but in this sequence , it hints that you will be constantly surrounded by death .	1
the woman continued droning , but the boy was zoning out again .	1
gee , good guess .	1
living in culiacan , with don miguel as your protector and benefactor , youre going to be surrounded by death .	1
what a stretch , and a surprise to one and all .	1
the nonstop weapons and survival training that jasmine had no doubt chatted with the woman about couldnt have been a tipoff or anything .	1
hell , all he had to do was close his eyes and he could bring death to the surface , fresh as though it had only occurred just yesterday .	1
incredibly insightful so far .	1
he was getting his moneys worth .	1
what was next ?	1
danger ?	1
uncertainty ?	1
and this , the defining card , is the king of swords .	1
but its inverted .	1
which is a negative sign .	1
it can mean many things , most of which involve destruction and selfish consequences inverted ?	1
the boy asked , finally interested in something shed said .	1
its upside down , the medium explained in a tremulous voice .	1
not to me , the boy observed .	1
he was sitting opposite her .	1
they were both correct .	1
the tense reading drew to an uncomfortable and abrupt close , the woman seeming suddenly anxious to be rid of them .	1
no doubt she felt shed done enough of her shtick for the hundred pesos and was hoping for more revenue for the day .	1
the boy couldnt believe anyone would buy her laughable song and dance and he was annoyed when jasmine lingered , murmuring with the old biddy , as they both flicked furtive glances at him .	1
once theyd cycled back home , the afternoon sun blazing through the drooping trees that sheltered the road from the worst of the heat , jasmine had seemed withdrawn and distant , showing no interest in a romantic interlude .	1
she hadnt responded well to the boys mockery of the reading as theyd pedaled , taking it as a personal affront to her sacred beliefs .	1
in retrospect , he could have chosen his few words with more kindness .	1
baffling bullshit could be misinterpreted , as could superstitious idiocy .	1
whatever the womans ability to divine the future , one thing changed forever , from that afternoon on .	1
jasmine and he were never the same , which he directly attributed to the vicious old witchs black predictions .	1
the old crone had the ability to foretell the future , all right , in that shed initiated a subtle campaign to undermine their relationship , for who knew what reason .	1
but he learned quickly that the power of superstition could be significant a lesson he would carry forward with him into life .	1
and he vividly remembered the final card that seemed to have such an effect on the venomous old faker the oldest of the tarot face cards , the reversed king of swords .	1
the previous months had passed with the topic of how to deal with the romantic fait-accompli aired often among the elders in the compound .	1
it was a constant sticking point between emilio and the ladies .	1
emilio was of the opinion that if the boy was going to be sampling his precious hothouse flowers bounty , he should plan on getting married , the sooner the better .	1
the ladies argued against any sort of confrontation , partially because of who he was , as well as mitigating their youth .	1
neither jasmine nor the boy had been aware of the seething disagreement their trysts caused , not that either of them would have been particularly interested in the older adults opinions .	1
the arrogance of youth inevitably believed in its supremacy , and the young were typically convinced that the aged had little grasp of how the modern world worked .	1
emilio and the ladies were terrified that the boy would use jasmine for his pleasure and then break her heart , and so it was with considerable surprise that emilio found the boy to be increasingly moody and dejected as his sixteenth summer wore on .	1
when emilio confronted him , the confession that the couple had been intimate came as no shock , but his complaint that jasmine had become uninterested in him and had decided that they werent compatible did .	1
emilio didnt know whether to be angry or relieved , but the boy was suffering , as only those experiencing the tender cuts of young love can , so he redoubled his training and poured on the challenges .	1
the boy lapped it up , growing more adept each day , and eventually moved beyond his infatuation with jasmine , even as she showed no further appetite for him .	1
it was as though a switch had been thrown shed swung from being obviously enamored to wanting nothing to do with him , confounding not only the boy , but also the adults .	1
still , emilio sensed that there was unfinished business between the two , and got the impression from the boy that his passage to other girls would be a bitter one , tainted by jasmines memory .	1
from the boys perspective , jasmines rejection was an abandonment , serving to remind him how foolish it was to trust others or allow them into your emotional life .	1
it was during that sixteenth summer that he made the mental resolution to be an island , impenetrable and aloof , using others for his convenience but nothing more .	1
the pain of the only thing he cared about in his life casting him aside was a fork in the road for him , where one possible future had involved love and trust , and the other led down a path where he was alone , suspicious and always on guard .	1
for the first time in his life hed opened up and entrusted jasmine with his heart , only to be repaid by her spitting in his face for his trouble .	1
his rigid training provided the solution : never allow anyone to get close , never reveal your true self , and never care .	1
and so it was that he found a philosophy that was useful , that afforded him some relief in his time of confused pain .	1
others had no innate value for him beyond what they could do to further his agenda or meet his demands .	1
they were objects that only existed as minor planets orbiting his solar system , in which he was the sun the giver of life and the destroyer of worlds .	1
his narcissism wasnt unusual for isolated youths who found every task or challenge laughably easy , but the combination of his violent past and jasmines snubbing of him , transformed him into the very character that the old medium woman had described when articulating the meaning of the reversed king of swords a selfish megalomaniac who would go to any lengths to satisfy his needs , even if it resulted in the destruction of others .	1
the boy had slim interest in considering the ramifications of his chosen worldview .	1
his training now consumed all of his free hours as he sought to exceed even the highest bars emilio could conjure as challenges .	1
hed increased his dojo sessions to five times a week and had quickly mastered most of the offered techniques .	1
his high school had graduated him early due to his advanced academic performance so he set about studying engineering and architecture in earnest , mainly as a guide to understanding how things operated or were built .	1
he had a ravenous intellect unlike any his instructors had ever seen ; a young man who could do or be whatever he wanted .	1
the future was beyond bright for him and he soon discovered that there were many willing young females who sought his attention and so , in time , jasmine became a distant memory , or so he told himself even as every new conquest brought a reminder of her .	1
the remainder of his sixteenth year was spent in rigorous pursuit of excellence , whether they were intellectual , physical , or defense-related endeavors .	1
his teen years were a defining period , where he honed his proficiency to a razors edge .	1
never before had emilio seen someone who could shoot as well or expertly disappear into the woods without a sound and become untraceable , or swim as athletically , or remain inscrutable through any circumstance .	1
the discipline emilio had sought to instill had yielded incredible dividends .	1
the boy was almost superhuman in his commitment and self-possession .	1
it was as though providence had blessed him with a surplus of fitness and acuity .	1
by the time he was due to turn seventeen , emilio was satisfied that his work with the boy was done .	1
hed made the transition from boy into young man , and the world was now his playground , to do with as he liked .	1
which made it all the more surprising when he vanished without a trace on the morning of his seventeenth birthday , don miguel dead , and the boy who was like his son gone without a trace .	1
chapter 4 eleven years ago , veracruz , mexico the navy base in veracruz was expansive , crawling with personnel and equipment .	1
this was the primary headquarters for the gulf region and was where the specialized training for the countrys equivalent of the seals took place the fuerzas especiales , or special forces .	1
this elite team of fighters had just been created after a reorganization of the navys marine infantry the marines .	1
the brass had decided it needed a special response organization that was trained to far higher standards than the already elite marines , and so they formed a group of five hundred specialist commandos , to be trained in explosives , parachuting , military diving , sniping , urban combat and vertical descent .	1
they would be mexicos ultimate ninja squad , to be used in the most dangerous of circumstances , on the most hazardous of missions .	1
after the young man had abruptly departed sinaloa hed floated around mexico for a few months , creating the appropriate paperwork so that he could join the navy using a virgin identity .	1
he quickly impressed his commanding officers with his supernatural weapons capabilities and was placed on the fast track for the new group .	1
he was the dream candidate for the job : young , athletic , a prodigy with guns , smart , fearless , and extremely tough .	1
if there had ever been a vocation specially made for him , being one of the new navy commandos was it .	1
even the motto resonated with him fuerza , espiritu , sabiduria .	1
force , spirit and wisdom .	1
he had all three in abundance and hed arrived at the perfect place to continue the education hed begun with emilio .	1
much as hed liked his mentor , it was clear to him that hed learned all he could and needed to go somewhere designed to produce professionals if he was going to progress as he wanted .	1
hed signed up a few months after his seventeenth birthday , although his new paperwork put his age at eighteen and a half .	1
that was a necessary artifice , as was his selection of a name so that he could start anew , without any baggage from his past .	1
the young man was now calling himself raul terenova , which was as good as any other , he supposed .	1
names were unimportant to him .	1
they were disposable , as was most everything in his life .	1
raul excelled in the brutal training conditions , which truth be told were kinder and more relaxed than the ones hed imposed upon himself for years .	1
but he learned a lot , especially on the explosives side .	1
there was nothing like the military to proffer the kind of training you just couldnt get in civilian life , no matter what you did .	1
his goal was to be an expert in every aspect of combat the special forces could teach him , and with his tenacity and discipline , hed quickly climbed to the top of his class and established records .	1
he became the model for all men who would follow , demanding more from himself than anything his trainers could have mustered .	1
young raul was far more motivated than any of his classmates to get all he could out of his service years .	1
he viewed his time with the military as a stepping stone , whereas his peers would go on to be career soldiers .	1
becoming a naval commando had been an idea hed grown fixated with when he was sixteen , after reading about the services plans to create a group of super soldiers .	1
he didnt have any burning desire to become a marine but if he was going to excel in the field hed been contemplating , the more skills he had , the more valuable he would be .	1
none of which he told his recruiting officer .	1
to the navy , hed presented himself as a fiercely patriotic young man who wanted to escape from a dull existence at home in rural chiapas and don a uniform that would get him instant respect and a life of adventure and action .	1
during basic training , he had stood out as far above the quality of the other green recruits .	1
his scores on the written exams had floored the instructors .	1
here was a candidate who was blisteringly smart , who could swim like a fish , shoot like a marksman , and had the physical prowess of a professional athlete .	1
there had been no question about moving him ahead of the queue and putting him into the specialized marine training and from there it became obvious that he should be one of the new elite commandos .	1
today , they were working on specialized sniping long range , which was considered to be anything over a thousand meters , or almost thirty-three hundred feet .	1
at such extreme distances , a variety of elements came into play , including wind strength and direction , humidity , temperature , elevation , and rate of movement if it wasnt a stationary target .	1
while there were recorded instances of snipers successfully killing from more than twenty-four hundred meters , those were considered anomalies .	1
at sixteen hundred meters , the target was a mile away .	1
to hit that distance with accuracy was considered virtually impossible for any but an impossibly small group of expert marksmen , although advents like laser rangefinders and computer software that would calculate the various elements had improved the odds .	1
the days exercise was on targets at a confirmed distance of a thousand meters , or roughly three quarters of a mile .	1
the rifle they were using for the exercise was an american-manufactured barrett m82 , a .50 caliber rifle with an effective range of eighteen hundred meters , although accuracy became iffy after nine hundred to a thousand meters .	1
sixteen hundred meters was considered acceptable if you were trying to hit a bomb or something larger than a human torso , but there were too many variables that could affect accuracy .	1
many snipers preferred the smaller .338 caliber rifles for precision , and the official sniper rifle for the marines was the heckler & koch psg1 firing a 7.65 millimeter round .	1
the problem was that the weapons accuracy dropped off at eight hundred meters , so special forces had secured fifteen of the much larger payload barrett rifles as a trial for standardization a substitute for the smaller psg1 .	1
each sniper cadet had been assigned a coach , who gave the firing order and then received a report from down-field .	1
accuracy had dropped off markedly once the seven hundred meter threshold had been crossed , and there were few who could deliver precise hits at over eight hundred .	1
what does your nose tell you ?	1
the coach asked raul .	1
moderate humidity .	1
guesstimate on wind speed and direction ?	1
seven to ten knots , out of the north-east , raul replied .	1
temperature ?	1
thirty degrees celsius .	1
were going to do this without the computer .	1
purely based on your observations .	1
if youre confident in your observations , adjust your bearings accordingly .	1
good luck , the coach said , and then stepped back , leaving the young man to himself .	1
raul concentrated on controlling his breathing , and soon his entire awareness was synthesized into the tiny world within the scope .	1
he made some minor corrections for his wind-speed guesstimate then gently massaged the trigger until the weapon fired , slamming into his shoulder with its considerable recoil .	1
hed long ago learned never to pull the trigger , as it could throw off accuracy .	1
a deliberate squeeze was best .	1
the radio crackled and the report came back .	1
a bulls-eye .	1
good shooting .	1
they repeated the exercise for ten shots , all of which landed within a ten inch grouping .	1
i think were done here , young man .	1
that was impressive shooting .	1
raul looked up at the coach .	1
he was emboldened by his success , and wanted to try for a personal best .	1
he got along well with the man , so he floated his idea .	1
why dont we try it at fifteen-hundred meters ?	1
just to make it interesting ?	1
raul suggested .	1
the coach looked at him like he was crazy .	1
pretty cocky , huh ?	1
thats an impossible range with that weapon and that ammo , not to mention that scope .	1
you want to put money on it ?	1
the coach asked .	1
fifteen hundred meters was just under a mile away , and was near the absolute maximum of the rifles range for a human-sized target .	1
two hundred pesos says i nail it three out of five .	1
although i agree that this ammo is crap for that distance .	1
id prefer to load it myself for better consistency , but hey , raul said .	1
fine .	1
but three misses , we go home and im two hundred richer .	1
the coach got on the radio and issued the instructions to the man downrange , who obligingly moved the target to the farthest point on the field before taking cover .	1
its your funeral .	1
fire when ready , the coach said .	1
raul took his time , made further adjustments to the scope , then repeated his meditation process where he became one with the weapon .	1
the discharge almost startled him , so focused was his concentration .	1
there was no need to wait for the radio to report .	1
he knew what it would say .	1
bulls-eye , twenty centimeters off center , the radio crackled .	1
to the right , or the left ?	1
or low or high ?	1
tell him to be specific , would you ?	1
raul groused .	1
wide-eyed , the coach studied raul like he was from another planet , then posed the question .	1
the response came back .	1
to the right .	1
thats what i thought hed say .	1
winds died down a hair in the last thirty seconds .	1
tell him to clear , raul said .	1
once he got the go ahead , he repeated the impossible shot .	1
four more times .	1
all shots grouped with under a foot of variance .	1
the coach gladly handed over the two hundred pesos for the single most astounding display of marksmanship hed ever witnessed .	1
youre a fucking monster , you know that ?	1
thats superhuman voodoo shit right there .	1
ive never seen anything like it , and ive been teaching for over ten years .	1
before that , i was one of the top three marksmen in mexico , the coach acceded , studying him with a kind of wonder .	1
those that can , do both men laughed together , in spite of a twenty-five-year age difference .	1
raul would never again shoot with that accuracy at that distance , preferring to limit his performance to more average expectations .	1
it wouldnt do to show off , or to develop too much of a reputation .	1
better to have had a one in a million day and then graduate in the top third of the class than at the top .	1
he remembered emilios sage counsel from when he was just a sprout .	1
never show too much of your hand .	1
to give your enemies information is to make a gift .	1
and friends can become enemies .	1
so know how good you are and then take private pleasure in that accomplishment .	1
becoming celebrated makes you a target .	1
better to be in the middle of the herd when the hunters come than at the head .	1
into the evening , raul enjoyed his place in the spotlight amongst his peers , as news of his exploit circulated .	1
as much as he enjoyed the adulation , a part of him knew that the hubris that came from being the best was a fickle charm , so he resolved to enjoy it for now , because it would be the last time he allowed others to get a glimpse of what he could actually do .	1
information was power , and allowing , no , inviting others to understand his capabilities was foolhardy .	1
his goal was to drain what experience he could from the service and then slip away like a ghost .	1
it would serve no useful purpose to be noticed any more than he already had been .	1
from that point on he would adopt a lower profile and continue to accumulate the pearls of experience until his work there was done .	1
he calculated that another three months of training and perhaps six months in the field would be sufficient , making for a total of a year and a half of his life devoted to the pursuit of excellence with mexicos finest .	1
that night , as he lay his head upon his bunk , he began a silent mental countdown .	1
to when he could begin his new , new life .	1
patience , he told himself , was a virtue that would pay enormous dividends it became his bedtime mantra .	1
he needed to maximize his learning while he was still in school .	1
thats how he viewed his life to the point hed arrived at it was his education .	1
the time would soon come when the pupil proved himself to be the master , but for now , he had lessons to absorb .	1
he still wanted to learn special operations parachuting not jumping out of planes and controlling his descent , but rather precision-guiding his drop to within a meter of his target point , from both high-altitude and low , which required different skills .	1
and he still needed more hours of scuba time , as well as some orientation on flying planes and helicopters .	1
the latter two werent on the curriculum , but he was lobbying to get them added .	1
you could never know too much .	1
with visions of his future cascading through his awareness , he slowly drifted off to sleep , his days toil finally at an end .	1
chapter 5 ten & a half years ago , veracruz , mexico the battered , rusting hull of the freighter ground against the old tires fastened to the concrete dock at one of the more remote cargo offloading piers on veracruz harbor .	1
flying a panamanian flag , caruso was at least forty years old , and had made the long trip from south america countless times .	1
the dark green paint on her dented steel sides bubbled at the rivets from underlying rust .	1
she looked to be on her last legs , as did many of the freighters that made their way into the busy deep water port .	1
the old ship was manifested as delivering coffee and bananas from colombia , which was largely true , although the money-making haul was the ten tons of cocaine stashed in the specially constructed compartments in her lower hold , which to cursory inspection appeared to be the floor of the cargo area inside the hull .	1
even if a nosy customs inspector had cared to pry open one of the scarred hatches , all he would have found was what appeared to be the slimy metal lining of the waterlogged bilge .	1
it was an ingenious design ; the modifications had taken place at a discreet shipyard in colon , panama while other refits were being attended to .	1
a veteran of the ongoing , frequent trade between south america and mexico , caruso was just one of thousands of vessels that offloaded cargo each year in veracruz , the principal importation hub for eastern mexico .	1
under normal circumstances she would have rendezvoused with a commercial fishing boat out in the gulf of mexico to transfer her illicit wares , well away from prying eyes , but the shrimper that had been the scheduled drop-off had experienced engine problems eighty miles en-route , so the hook-up had been cancelled .	1
that had left the captain with two choices toss ten tons of cocaine overboard and lose the shipment and his tidy slice of the profits , or hope that the receiving group could arrange for an alternative offloading plan while the ship was laid over in veracruz for two days .	1
worst case , she could steam out , supposedly empty , on her way back to colombia for more fruit and java , and meet with another boat ; but every minute caruso sat in the harbor she was in jeopardy .	1
particularly tonight , when la familia , a rival splinter faction of the gulf cartel , had decided to use the mexican marines as a vehicle to cause their competitors grief , by tipping law enforcement off to the shipment .	1
it was not unusual for the cartels to exchange information with the military or the police to create problems for their enemies most of the drug seizures that took place did so because of the constant infighting and jockeying for advantage that was a routine aspect of the trade .	1
it was far more ergonomic to use the militarys muscle instead of your own , and if the rivals got into a firefight in the process , so much the better .	1
the marines had long been considered the only incorruptible branch of the military .	1
the army was notoriously riddled with rot but the marines , for whatever reason , couldnt be bought off , and so were the most feared of the law enforcement branches .	1
in mexico , the army and navy worked alongside the police and federales for internal security , which included battling the drug cartels , especially since the recent reorganization into more specialized groups .	1
it hadnt been broadly publicized , but since 2000 , when vincente fox became president of mexico , the country had been embroiled in a de facto civil war , with the cartels having far greater resources than the army and navy .	1
the total budget for the army was less than a percent of gdp , which put it at considerably under a billion dollars .	1
contrast that to the over fifty billion dollars per year in wholesale value of cocaine that moved through the cartels .	1
at an eighty to ninety percent margin , that left the narcotraficantes with vastly greater resources than the army .	1
since the mexicans had taken over cocaine trafficking for the colombians , and begun manufacturing methamphetamines in earnest , the money had gotten crazy .	1
mexico found itself in much the same situation colombia had faced in the 1980s and 1990s , when it was routine for judges , police chiefs and army generals to be executed en masse by the colombian cartels , or rather their armed enforcers ; the myriad purportedly revolutionary groups that controlled half the country and increasingly acted as private armies for the drug lords .	1
the lions share of the profits had shifted from colombia to mexico as colombia contented itself with the far lower-risk and less violent business of production , leaving the transport and distribution to their better-positioned mexican associates .	1
the profits in colombia were still significant , with one to two hundred percent markup to the mexicans , but the margin in trafficking internationally was five to tenfold .	1
a kilo of cocaine that cost the mexicans twenty-five hundred to three-thousand dollars in colombia would fetch twenty-five thousand a kilo wholesale across the u.s. border , and that was usually significantly cut with buffering agents in order to dilute the nearly pure cocaine , thereby increasing the apparent quantity once repackaged for the states ; so in actuality it was more like an effective thirty to thirty-five thousand sale price for that original kilo by the end of the day .	1
the incredible margins were a direct function of the illegality of the substances in the target market the united states .	1
as with alcohol margins during the ill-fated experiment of prohibition in the 1930s , criminalization of drugs turned what would have been a five percent profit business into a thousand or more percent trade , which created windfall profits for everyone in the supply chain and also created a situation where every aspect was worth killing for .	1
there were no open gun battles over cigarette or alcohol profits because once a substance was legal , the efficiencies of the distribution chains kicked in and it became a boring commercial enterprise .	1
but keeping the substances illegal , especially since they were in huge demand , caused profits to go through the roof .	1
and so it was that a group of provincial , unsophisticated mexican farmers became the most powerful narcotics trafficking empires in the world , commanding the sorts of budgets that were the envy of many medium-sized countries .	1
mexico bore the brunt of the violence that ensued from the power struggles , principally because it was the geographic gateway to the largest market for drugs in the world the united states .	1
the harbor was quiet at three a.m. , and the wharf area where caruso was tethered was deserted , save for two men smoking cigarettes on the concrete pier , and an uninterested security guard at the massive docks entry point , where it connected to land .	1
the marines had taken position in the surrounding buildings , having been told that there was a complement of at least a dozen heavily armed men on board , guarding against any incursions to steal their precious cargo .	1
the leader of the commando team made a series of hand signals , and the men fanned out , while raul set up his rifle tripod and adjusted his scope .	1
range was six hundred meters at the closest point , which would be a cakewalk for him were it not for the twenty knot gusting breeze hed need to factor in .	1
this was his first active operation since graduating from the special forces course so he felt a tingle of anticipation before finally testing his skills in a real-world environment .	1
shooting at paper targets or silhouettes on a range was one thing , but being in the thick of it with enemies who were shooting back was quite another .	1
this operation would be a tricky one , in that the commander didnt want to get into a gun battle if he didnt have to .	1
his first plan was to use subterfuge and approach the vessel with several plain-clothed men under his command , subdue the two lookouts with stun guns , and then move the bulk of the commandos swiftly down the dock to the gangplank , boarding the old scow before anyone knew what had happened .	1
raul had questioned the logic involved but didnt say anything .	1
if it had been his operation he would have approached with a half dozen well-armed divers from the waterside , and used lines to climb up the side of the ship , or alternatively , taken out the two smoking sentries from the harbor end of the dock , firing from the waterline and killing them instantly before moving his squad onto the pier from the water , where nobody would be expecting any attack .	1
if he was one of the smugglers on the ship , and the marines intelligence on the number of armed men was correct , he would have had at least two lookouts , one with a night-vision scope , surveying the dock for the slightest hint of trouble .	1
if there was going to be a gun battle , youd want to pick the distance at which you engaged wisely , in order to be able to hold off any assailants while you made an escape .	1
hed have had a high-speed tender secured to the ships stern as a get-away contingency , and would also have had a man watching the water approach , just in case .	1
because you never , ever really knew you had to expect the unexpected .	1
but it wasnt his place to second-guess his superiors and he was interested to see how the exercise would play out .	1
he gave the marines a less than twenty percent chance of taking the ship without a battle , which meant that hed see some real action .	1
finally .	1
albeit from a distance but , in truth , that was preferred .	1
hed long ago concluded that it was far safer to be sniping from afar than to be a hero rushing into a hail of slugs .	1
leave that to his peers .	1
hed pick off his targets with surgical precision before they knew what hit them .	1
two large norwegian wharf rats scurried down the dock , away from the ship and the two smoking men .	1
these were big rodents ; their bodies were a good eighteen inches long , with tails to match scavengers the size of small dogs .	1
the pier area was infested with them and the city had long ago given up on trying to bring the population under control .	1
poison had been only moderately effective , and one genius had the idea of releasing a horde of hungry felines which had resulted in a feral cat infestation in addition to the rats , which were large enough to go ten rounds with a cat without breaking a sweat .	1
slicks of oil floated on the surface of the water from leaking bilges ; the port had a pervasive odor of decay and long-dead fish , and the particular petroleum stink common to industrial waterfronts the world over .	1
raul studied the battered ships bridge for signs of life , scanning slowly over the superstructure and taking his time at each of the helms reinforced windows .	1
those would pose a problem , as theyd be at least inch-thick glass , designed to withstand the pressure of the massive waves that could surge over the four hundred feet of bow and ship and slam into the tower .	1
he knew from his reading that oceangoing vessels were designed to withstand seas up to sixty feet in height , the theory being that waves didnt get any larger than that .	1
of course , the hundred foot rogue waves that had been recorded with some regularity were ignored by the industry because if you built ships that could survive those , they would be too expensive .	1
so everyone pretended that sixty was the maximum , and when hundreds of boats were lost in any given period , it was shoulder shrugs and profit statements that everyone focused on .	1
his night-vision scope illuminated the bridge in an eerie green .	1
there were two armed sentries visible on the superstructure , one outside on the bridge walkway , and the other inside .	1
he could just make out the gleam of binoculars from the interior , so in rauls opinion the chances of the commanders scheme working had diminished to less than zero .	1
he was glad it wasnt his ass on the line for this one .	1
perhaps , instead of the sea approach , raul might have had a flight of four to six men parachute in , touching down on the rear of the ship , taking out the sentries as they descended .	1
virtually anything other than a direct assault down the dock .	1
no wonder the military casualties in the drug wars were so high .	1
with operational plans that amounted to brandishing a saber and screaming , charge !	1
there could be little expectation of anything but a blood bath .	1
he didnt envy his fellow commandos their duty tonight .	1
there was no way this would go well .	1
he adjusted his scope to compensate for the stiffening wind , and calculate the distance with his laser rangefinder .	1
six-hundred seventy-four meters .	1
like shooting fish in a barrel , he thought , allowing himself the private luxury of a small smile .	1
his face , like those of his fellow commandos , was blacked out with camouflage paint so as to avoid giving off any shine , lending his profile an evil glint akin to that of an escaped demon .	1
the smile was anything but reassuring .	1
the commander gave the signal and the two undercover men exited the building , one holding a bottle of mescal in his hand and talking loudly in an inebriated slur .	1
given that there was no way they wouldnt be spotted , the bright idea was that they were to be friendly , drunken dock workers , and once the two smoking guards were dispatched , they would pretend to engage in a scuffle and some security guards would come running to break up the fight .	1
when there were six men in total by the gangplank theyd breach the ship , and more would pour out of the building and reinforce them from there .	1
in addition to the stun guns , the men on the dock would be equipped with grenades and machine pistols , as would the bogus security guards , so the presumption was that they could take the ship by surprise and keep the foe engaged until the main body of commandos made it down the dock .	1
they had two vehicles waiting to race out , filled with armed men who could be at the gangplank in fifteen seconds from the time the signal was given .	1
it seemed like suicide to raul , but it wasnt his job to craft a better plan .	1
he was only there to shoot , which he was now perfectly positioned to do .	1
this may have been his first assault but he had enough common sense to understand that even when the commandos prevailed , and they would prevail eventually due to vastly larger numbers , the cost in human life would be high on both sides , whereas a surgical strike could have accomplished much the same result with minimal special forces casualties .	1
it was inefficient , which offended his sense of symmetry more than anything .	1
he watched as the two men staggered their way down the pier and then returned his full attention to the bridge .	1
the pair of undercover operatives , by the time they made it to the two sentries , would be out of sight of the bridge due to the angle of the hull .	1
unless of course , the two guards moved , in which case the plan would be a disaster , or alternatively , would need to be aborted .	1
walking headfirst into a killing zone was generally bad strategy anywhere in the world , not just in mexico , and he couldnt see the commander barreling forward if the plan was doomed to failure .	1
at least he hoped not .	1
the sentry on the exterior of the bridge was carrying a machine pistol of some sort it looked like an uzi to raul .	1
that meant limited useful range and accuracy .	1
the uzi was an antiquated design with an effective range of two hundred meters , which was fine for typical close-quarter urban combat , but lousy for applications requiring accuracy at a distance .	1
a better and more popular choice as far as raul was concerned was the kalashnikov akm , the modernized version of the venerated ak-47 , which had double the effective range in single fire mode , or at least three hundred meters when fired full-auto ; or probably the best weapon , and his personal favorite for dependability and accuracy in a mid-range assault rifle , the american-built m4 .	1
its five-hundred-meter effective range and extremely high muzzle velocity made it the ideal choice for assault applications , which more than compensated for its relatively small slug size .	1
hed fired all three with emilio for years and could disassemble and reassemble any of them in a matter of seconds , so he knew whereof he spoke .	1
their luck wasnt going well so far .	1
the two smoking sentries on the dock moved toward the men , so any engagement would take place in plain sight of the bridge .	1
that would mean a full-blown firefight with no cover , likely with a very high toll on the special forces side .	1
he exhaled , stilling his mind in preparation for the imminent attack , and zeroed the barrett m82 sniper rifle in on the bridge sentrys upper torso .	1
the .50 caliber m1022 slug would tear a hole through him the size of a baseball at that range so there was no question in his mind that it would only take a single trigger pull to dispatch him .	1
it would be a few more seconds before the shit hit the fan so he slid two more full magazines next to the rifle , where he could quickly change them out once he was empty .	1
the man in the bridge was still his biggest concern .	1
he made a mental note to always carry one magazine of full-jacketed armor-piercing rounds in case he needed to slice through an inch of metal or reinforced glass .	1
it was show time .	1
he fixed the bridge target in the crosshairs and waited for instruction .	1
the commander was watching the approach and not liking what he saw .	1
he , like raul , understood that if the bridge sentries werent caught unawares , the assault would become a slaughterhouse , with his men taking heavy casualties .	1
after struggling with an internal debate , the commander murmured into the com system .	1
one of the two men on the dock had an earpiece , and upon hearing the commanders instructions , grabbed his friend and turned him around , as if only now noticing the two smoking men cautiously approaching them .	1
the mission had been aborted .	1
shit , the commander hissed , and began pacing , mulling over his choices .	1
now theyd probably have to just pull up in armored vehicles and do this the hard way , shooting it out with no element of surprise .	1
raul bit his tongue , but then decided to advance his idea , purely in the interests of keeping his role in the assault interesting and getting some more practical experience .	1
taking out a single sentry from almost a thousand meters wasnt really much of a challenge .	1
it was a single shot .	1
maybe two , if they would send someone to find some armor-piercing rounds .	1
sir .	1
might i have a word ?	1
raul asked .	1
the commander regarded him with surprise .	1
raul was one of his best men , but he never spoke .	1
he was a loner , with no close relationships within the corps .	1
this isnt a great moment .	1
yes , sir .	1
i know , sir .	1
i just had an observation that came to me as i was watching the target that may be of some use to you , sir , raul explained , sucking up his pride and taking the expected supplicant tone .	1
very well .	1
make it quick , the commander barked .	1
we need to coordinate a frontal assault before this goes on much longer .	1
permission to approach , sir ?	1
get on with it .	1
raul moved to the commanders side , and spoke in a low , calm tone , explaining his ideas and arguing for an amphibian assault .	1
the commander listened carefully , and then cut him off after forty-five seconds .	1
that would require far more stealth and luck than weve had tonight .	1
its a good strategy , and i appreciate your sharing it with me , but i dont think we can afford to waste two more hours preparing it .	1
no , i think well do a good old-fashioned frontal assault and take our punches .	1
in the end , wed have to do one anyway if your plan failed , so my call is to just cut to the chase , the commander declared , summarily dismissing the idea .	1
raul considered arguing the point and then decided that he didnt care that much .	1
hed still get to shoot a couple of bad guys , at least , and what did he care in the end if half the squad got mowed down ?	1
yes , sir .	1
thank you for hearing me out , sir .	1
if were going to do a frontal , could i please get a magazine of armor-piercing rounds ?	1
theyll come in handy to take out the gunman inside the bridge , raul requested .	1
the commander nodded and called on the com to one of the team members waiting in the next building .	1
twenty minutes .	1
youll have em .	1
well move in thirty .	1
the commander spun around and began issuing orders in preparation for a brute-force assault .	1
theyd need a couple of armored personnel carriers enough to carry forty men .	1
he ordered up two unimog armored trucks and two btr-70 armored carriers : eight-wheeled vehicles that could accommodate seven commandos each , along with a three man crew to operate the turret-mounted 14.5 mm heavy machine gun and smaller 7.62 mm machine gun .	1
the fallback plan was much more straightforward .	1
drive up to the ship .	1
deploy men if no firing takes place and seize the ship .	1
if the sentries or crew decided to shoot it out , blast away at everything in sight and shoot their way through the ship until the crew either surrendered , or was dead .	1
it was inelegant and would result in a lot of bullets flying but it had the benefit of simplicity .	1
twenty-five minutes later , a young commando approached raul and handed him a magazine with five rounds of armor-piercing .50 caliber bullets , apologizing that they couldnt find any more at such short notice .	1
raul thanked him , and emptied half of one of the spare magazines , counting out five shells and replacing them with the five armor-piercing rounds .	1
he ejected the current bullet in the rifle and chambered one of the new armor-piercing cartridges , then returned to watching the sentries through his night-vision scope .	1
the commander checked his watch , and at precisely three-forty a.m. ordered the assault , after which everything happened quickly .	1
the two gray btr-70s , which resembled small tanks more than anything else , rumbled around the corner and out onto the pier , followed by the two hulking trucks .	1
the sentries on the dock froze , staring in numb disbelief at the apparition , and then hurriedly scuttled up the gangplank and disappeared up into the ship .	1
one mans head reappeared for a few seconds and then the gangplank collapsed onto the concrete pier below .	1
the crash was almost immediately followed by the steel watertight door slamming shut with a boom .	1
as it was barred from within , the grinding of the cogs was audible halfway down the dock , even over the baritone growl of the vehicles .	1
it was going to be considerably harder to take the freighter now because the traffickers were forewarned .	1
the easy access to the ship from the gangplank was gone and the commandos on the dock would be in a siege situation against a ship whose hull rose easily four stories above the pier , with no obvious entry point available .	1
the commander watched in a kind of frozen frustration , and then the shooting started ; gunmen emerged from the interior of the ship , moved to the edge of the hull and began firing from behind the protection of the heavy steel from which the hardy old vessel was built .	1
raul took in the situation for a few moments , waiting for the right instant , and squeezed the trigger .	1
the guns boom was deafening .	1
ears ringing , he watched with satisfaction as both the sentry standing outside the bridge and the man inside collapsed .	1
hed timed it so that he fired when the outside man was directly in front of the man inside the bridge , effectively killing two birds with one armor-piercing stone .	1
no reason to waste his precious ammo , after all .	1
he swiveled his attention to the hull , where he could just make out heads popping up here and there , like a nocturnal version of whack-a-mole at a fairground stall .	1
a man wearing a baseball cap leaned over the railing and fired his weapon at the vehicles below .	1
raul caressed the trigger again and watched as the shooters head vaporized .	1
moving down the line , he waited for an opening and took out another .	1
he was now four down with three shells , which he felt was a fair contribution to the ensuing train wreck of an operation .	1
raul peered through the scope , trying to find any other obvious targets , but the gunmen along the side of the ship had figured out there was a sniper at work , and had retreated into the superstructure , barring the watertight deck entry door in the process .	1
the gun turrets on the btr-70s opened up with their armor-piercing rounds , but quickly discovered that their shells , which could easily penetrate up to a one and a half inch steel plate , were just denting the massive hull , which had been fashioned from considerably thicker material .	1
that left the commandos and the traffickers in a classic mexican standoff .	1
shooting from the ship had stopped other than from a lone gunman who hadnt made it inside in time , but was behind the bulk of the bridges tower and so out of rauls line of sight .	1
firing from the two btr-70s had also stopped , though the entire waterfront area still resonated with receding echoes of gunfire .	1
the commander barked orders into the radio and the men emptied from the personnel carriers and took up position to mount an assault .	1
the men below flung three grappling hooks affixed to black nylon rope over the hulls edge .	1
the four-pronged hooks all found a purchase .	1
the problem was that any men on the ropes who got caught in the fire from the remaining gunman were dead meat , so nobody wanted to be the first to climb four stories up onto the deck .	1
raul decided to shift his position and moved down the row of warehouse windows until he was more symmetrically placed and could see down the entire length of the ship .	1
he set his rifle tripod down , careful not to jar the weapon , and resumed peering through the scope .	1
there , at the farthest end of the ship , right near the stern , was the gunman , taking cover below the three-foot-high lip of the boats deck edge .	1
raul calculated the distance and added an additional forty yards and adjusted accordingly , then waited for the mans head to pop back up .	1
it was just a matter of time , he figured correctly , as it turned out and his vigilance was rewarded by the mans arms and head coming into view as he prepared to empty his weapon at the commandos below .	1
raul took his shot , and the mans head dissolved in a bloody spray of fragments .	1
the deck was now empty , although it would still be ugly fighting through the ship .	1
not his problem .	1
the commander gave the squad the all-clear signal , and within seconds commandos were moving swiftly up the ropes to the ship above .	1
raul had shifted his attention to the bridge windows again , figuring it would just be a matter of time until some bright lad figured out that he could shoot from the portholes that stretched another four stories above the ships deck , picking off soldiers as they climbed over the rail .	1
sure enough , one of the glass hatches on the side opened , and a gun barrel poked out .	1
he waited patiently because the angle of the shooters barrel wouldnt allow him to hit the deck , and sure enough , more of the weapon slowly emerged from the window until raul also saw the arm that was holding it .	1
the first commandos were only a few feet from the edge so he only had a second before theyd be exposed to the gunman .	1
raul fired , and the assault rifle tumbled harmlessly to the deck below , taking three quarters of the mans still-attached arm with it .	1
that would give the rest inside something to think about .	1
from there on out it was a textbook incursion .	1
they had to use explosives to blow the doors open , and for fifteen minutes , bursts of gunfire echoed throughout the boats hull .	1
eventually the commander got an all clear call from the men inside , and a status report .	1
theyd taken out six hostiles , no survivors , and lost nine men in the process .	1
raul listened to the recitation impassively , his face betraying nothing .	1
the commander glanced at him as he heard the casualty assessment , but raul was busy packing up his gear , his work for the night finished .	1
the commander approached him and stopped a few feet away , studying the silent sniper as he finished stowing his weapon into a long padded case .	1
great shooting .	1
you saved a lot of lives tonight , the commander said .	1
raul bit his tongue , didnt blurt out his natural reaction , which was that if hed been allowed to lead an amphibian team they would have likely lost only a few men , if any , thanks to the element of surprise , and that the commander had killed those commandos with his lack of flair and imagination just as surely as if hed pulled the trigger himself .	1
instead , he nodded and stood , shouldering the rifle case and hoisting his bag .	1
thank you , sir .	1
i had some lucky shots tonight .	1
we were all fortunate .	1
there being nothing more to say , he saluted with his free hand before descending the stairs to join the remainder of his team .	1
it would be a long stretch of duty as the bodies were recovered and the drugs inventoried and he wanted to get out of the commanders sight before his contempt for the man leaked through his veneer .	1
it wasnt worth it .	1
most of the world was composed of idiots the commander was simply one dolt of many , and nothing raul said or did would change things .	1
it was that night , on his first live operation , that he realized hed probably already learned everything he was going to from the military .	1
the time had already come , after little over a year in the service , to reconsider his options .	1
chapter 6 ten years ago , sinaloa , mexico eighteen months after joining the marines , raul disappeared without a trace , leaving nothing behind to be remembered by except his assumed name , which hed quickly grown to despise .	1
hed participated in seven more operations after his first one , and with each mission he became more convinced that his talents were being wasted and he wasnt progressing any further .	1
to make matters worse , he witnessed countless acts of bumbling bureaucracy by the ranking officers , costing the men under their command casualties for no good reason .	1
if anything had ever convinced him that he wouldnt do well working for someone else , his half year of active duty after completing his boot camp and all the specialized training had done the trick .	1
when he walked off the base for the last time , ostensibly on two days leave to go visit his fictional family in chiapas , it was with an audible sigh of relief .	1
raul had saved almost all of his meager pay and still had a few thousand dollars from the money hed left home with , after selling his weapons to convert his assets into cash .	1
his identity papers had cost him six hundred dollars in mexico city , and hed done some odd jobs before joining the navy , but he would need to put the next part of his grand plan into operation fairly soon if he was going to avoid having to work as a day laborer .	1
fortunately , the cartels hed been battling were generous employers , able to pay far more than the navy , so he could pretty much choose which cartel he wanted to approach ; as an ex-marine theyd be eager to have him as part of their enforcement team .	1
although he had different ideas about how he could be of service to them .	1
he was now three months shy of his nineteenth birthday and free to do as he pleased .	1
yet there was some unfinished business he needed to attend to back in sinaloa before he moved on to the next phase of his life .	1
his departure had stuck in his craw , and he felt a pull to return while hed told himself that he was completely over jasmine , the truth was that a part of him had always assumed that her rejection had been some sort of youthful power play , and that shed get over it and see reason in time .	1
whether or not that was deluded wishful thinking , he needed to put it behind him once and for all , and with time on his hands and a more mature perspective , he decided to return to his old haunts and see for himself how things now sat .	1
hed learned to trust his judgment on these things , so he hopped on a bus and began the long trip from veracruz to culiacan .	1
wearing the uniform of a special forces commando , he was afforded privilege by the bus company so thankfully it cost him almost nothing to cross the nation .	1
two days after hed left his naval career behind , he descended the stairs in culiacan , blinking into the bright sunlight of an early spring day .	1
after forty-two hours cramped on buses , eating whatever junk he could get at the irregular stops , his first order of business was to have a decent meal .	1
he set off in search of a restaurant that had been his favorite , back in the day .	1
outside the terminal , he hailed a cab , reciting the address from memory to the driver as he slid into the back seat .	1
the young man had changed since hed last been in town , as had the city itself , growing by leaps and bounds .	1
his carefully trimmed goatee and closely cropped military haircut ensured nobody would recognize him , which wasnt much of an issue considering his long absence .	1
hed developed into a hardened combat veteran since leaving as a teen boy and his bearing and additional muscle weight filled out his uniform , lending him a formidable presence .	1
the boy had left and had returned a man .	1
the taxi arrived at the restaurant , la chuparrosa enamorada , nestled on the banks of the canal rosales .	1
the young man paid the driver and stepped out onto the pavement , hoisting his duffle as he studied the restaurant faade .	1
it was a tuesday , so the breakfast business was thin , which wouldnt have been the case had it been the weekend .	1
the place typically had a standing-room crowd on saturdays and sundays , due to the generous portions of mouthwatering food and the soothing waterside ambiance .	1
he had been there a few times with emilio on special occasions and it was one of the things that had been on his mind since boarding the bus in veracruz .	1
when he entered the large dining room , his boots thumping on the saltillo tile floor , the waitress approached and invited him to an outdoor table overlooking the water .	1
after a cursory glance at the familiar menu , he ordered a glass of orange juice and a plate of chicken chilaquiles in red sauce a local favorite and one of the restaurants signature dishes .	1
while he waited for his food to come he thought about his next move , glancing around absently as he remarked to himself on how little things had changed there in the last twenty months .	1
in this sleepy area , things seemed to always remain the same , even as the city grew at an unprecedented rate .	1
the waitress arrived with a heaping platter of breakfast , and as he tucked in he ran down his mental list .	1
the first thing he would need to do was secure reliable transportation .	1
taxis werent going to be an option for what he had in mind , so hed need to get some sort of conveyance sooner rather than later .	1
with his bankroll being as thin as it was , that meant stealing something , or probably several somethings , depending on how far he decided to travel .	1
he munched on his food , savoring the rich , spicy sauce , and cleaned his plate as efficiently as a dishwasher would .	1
stuffed , he paid the bill and strolled out onto the rural road , scanning the surroundings for something he could liberate opportunistically .	1
it took him half an hour to spot a suitable vehicle that was easy enough to break into and hotwire , but he eventually found a thirty-year-old chevrolet truck with a broken wind wing .	1
within seconds , he was in the cab , scanning the surrounding street to ensure that he hadnt been detected .	1
it took him ten seconds to find the ignition wires and soon he was meandering down the familiar road that led to don miguels estate .	1
the landscape was still verdant and wild , nature seemingly impatient to encroach on the slim progress man had introduced .	1
when he was a quarter mile from the turnoff to the ranch , he pulled the old truck onto a dirt track that led into the wilds and parked where it couldnt be seen from the road .	1
he had no idea what he would find at the hacienda when he made it to the estate , but hed learned to be cautious about everything and considered it best to err on the side of prudence .	1
he moved stealthily through the woods until he found one of the myriad game trails that ran through the immense tract of don miguels property , and soon was jogging along as he had in the old days .	1
it was cool in february so he barely broke a sweat as he moved effortlessly through the foliage .	1
before long , he was in the cluster of trees that ran along the side of the property , near the horse barn where hed so long ago been set to move hay as the commencement of his training .	1
he paused momentarily , ears straining for any hint of habitation , but he detected nothing .	1
the main house was deserted , with none of the security men that were everywhere when hed been living there .	1
no matter ; he hadnt come for anything in the house .	1
he wanted to see his mentor , emilio , and of course , his daughter .	1
for all his efforts jasmine had survived in the place shed carved out of his psyche , and he wanted to bring closure to a door that bulged , and threatened to burst open in his recurring dreams .	1
the young man continued along the perimeter and down the track until he reached the caretakers house that reposed several hundred yards into the woods .	1
he knew that trail like hed been on it only yesterday , the loosely placed flagstone that served as a driveway all too familiar under his feet .	1
surprisingly , he felt a buzz of anxiety in the pit of his stomach as he neared the front door an altogether alien sensation for him .	1
there , sitting as it always had , was the modest colonial home , deliberately styled in a rustic , sponge-painted manner to mirror the design sensibility of the larger main house , but absent the more flamboyant frills .	1
pausing on the front porch , he registered that there was something different about the home than the last time hed seen it , almost two years ago .	1
it seemed quiet , as though nobody was living there much like the main estate had appeared from a distance .	1
shaking off the sense of foreboding , he knocked on the door , and when he heard nothing from inside , he walked around the side to where emilio parked his big navy blue ford lobo crew-cab truck .	1
there it sat , unchanged , next to the small chevy econo-box emilio had bought for jasmine with his bonuses from don miguel .	1
he moved back onto the porch , and knocked again .	1
emilio .	1
jasmine .	1
please .	1
open the door .	1
its meim back he yelled .	1
from inside , he heard a faint rustling , and then jasmines distinctive voice .	1
go away .	1
theres nothing for you here .	1
jasmine .	1
please .	1
open the door .	1
i need to talk to your father .	1
its important , he tried again .	1
hes dead .	1
everyones dead .	1
don miguel , my father , his sister and his mother .	1
theres only me left now , and i dont want to see you .	1
please .	1
just leave .	1
go now , and stay away , jasmine warned .	1
dead ?	1
how ?	1
how is that possible ?	1
whats happened since i left ?	1
tell me , jasmine .	1
please .	1
just open the door .	1
i dont want to have this conversation through a slab of wood .	1
i just travelled over a thousand miles to see youplease , jasmine .	1
im begging you .	1
i need to see you .	1
no you dont .	1
you left without a word to anyone , and now death has come to the valley , and its only me left alive and you .	1
do yourself a favor , and leave now , while you can , jasmine implored him .	1
if you dont open the door , ill break in .	1
you know i can find a way .	1
jasmine , please .	1
this has gone on long enough .	1
open the damned door so we can speak like adults .	1
i need to know what happenedand i need your help , he finished , hoping the appeal would stir something in her .	1
he could understand that she might not want to see him , but there were too many unanswered questions for him to take no for an answer .	1
after a seemingly eternal pause , the lock rattled and the door creaked open .	1
it was dark in the small living room , all the drapes pulled , he saw as jasmine padded in bare feet back to the chair in front of the television and sat .	1
she was wearing a nightgown even though it was close to noon .	1
it was so dim that he could hardly make her out .	1
can we turn on a light or open a window ?	1
i cant see my own hand in front of me .	1
iim comfortable with it like this .	1
this is my house now , so i keep it the way i like .	1
if you have a problem with it , leave , jasmine advised in a monotone .	1
what the hell was going on here ?	1
even after two years , people didnt change that much .	1
what had happened ?	1
jasmine .	1
no problem .	1
you want it dark , i like it dark .	1
can we start over ?	1
tell me what happened to your father , emilio .	1
please .	1
start at the beginning .	1
i havent had any news since i left .	1
i see you have a uniform .	1
marines .	1
is that what happened to you ?	1
you ran away and joined the navy ?	1
thats classic .	1
a total clich , she exclaimed with a bitter laugh .	1
its a little more complicated than that .	1
but tell me about your father .	1
jasmine let out a long sigh , and sank further into the large , padded reclining chair one of emilios few luxuries ; a place he could relax at the end of a long , hard day and watch some television in peace .	1
when you left , you got out just in time .	1
someone executed don miguel , as well as one of his lieutenants , either that same day or the day after .	1
i dont really remember now , so much happened so quickly .	1
anyway , nobody knew what to do , and it was chaos here .	1
but word traveled fast , because before don miguel was in the ground , his rivals where fighting over how his empire would be divided up .	1
it quickly escalated into the usual blood feud , and soon culiacans streets were littered with the dead , jasmine explained .	1
only the young man knew what had transpired between himself and don miguel before leaving the state the event hadnt been witnessed by anyone , and nobody had any reason to suspect the quiet boy who was like his son .	1
after the drug lord had disappeared , in the chaos that followed no one had much cared what had happened to the boy .	1
and your father ?	1
one night , several trucks showed up at the house , and we heard gunfire .	1
the main contender for the dons position , armand altamar , had decided to eliminate anyone who was still loyal to the don , in a bid to seal his position as the new jefe for this region .	1
he executed the few remaining staff at the houseand then he came for us .	1
my father had several guns and he tried to defend us , and even killed three of altamars henchmen , but in the end it was for nothing .	1
there were too many of them , and they shot him to death , out in front of the porchlike a dog .	1
he died there for no reason other than for loyalty to his boss altamar had no reason to kill him , but he did anyway , without as much thought as stepping on an ant .	1
papahe wasnt even in the business .	1
he just ran the horses , and raised you , her voice trailed off .	1
jasmine , im so sorry .	1
ii dont know what to say theres nothing to say .	1
after killing him , they broke down the door , dragged my grandmother and auntie outside and shot them in the head .	1
good god .	1
ithank god you escaped but i didnt , dont you see ?	1
i tried to shoot them but i was shaking too much , and my first shot missed .	1
so then they came for meand the restis history , she said flatly .	1
what happened , jasmine .	1
you can tell me .	1
he didnt know how to react to the horrible story and was afraid to hear the rest but he couldnt help himself .	1
what happened ?	1
what happened ?	1
with nobody here to protect me , with you gone and my family killed ?	1
they took turns raping me , is what happened over and over , for half the night .	1
i passed out , and when i came to , they were raping me more .	1
it went on for hours .	1
ijasmine .	1
i know nothing i can say or do will make anything better .	1
but ill find these men and punish them for what they did to you .	1
theyll pay , with interest added .	1
just go .	1
i dont want your help .	1
my life is over before it had a chance to really begin .	1
its not your fault but i dont want to see you ever again .	1
you remind me of beforewhen i had hope jasmine , listen to me .	1
theres still hope .	1
i know what happened was horrible and will stay with you forever but theres always hope .	1
always .	1
ill make this right , or at least avenge your family and you , the young man promised .	1
no you wont .	1
and no , theres no hope .	1
trust me .	1
none .	1
theres always hope , jasmine youre an idiot .	1
for you , maybe there is , but not for me .	1
i didnt finish the story .	1
you didnt let me .	1
after they were done with me , every orifice brutalized and bleeding , the leader , altamar , went into the barn and got some of the acid they used on the glass tiles in the fountain to remove the calcium deposits , as i remember .	1
theyd always wear gloves , and mix it fifty parts water to one part acid .	1
it was the only thing that would remove the buildup .	1
altamar didnt wear gloves , and he didnt mix it .	1
he just poured it on my face , laughing as my skin fizzed with screaming agony .	1
last thing i remember was trying to make it to the kitchen to rinse it off my face with water .	1
that probably saved my life .	1
she stopped and peered at him through the gloom .	1
i wish theyd killed me .	1
ive sat here many times , ever since they released me from the hospital , wishing i was dead .	1
id kill myself but it would damn my soul to hell forever , according to the priest who stops in occasionally to mitigate my torment .	1
so i sit in the dark , and pray to an unlikely god to end my misery .	1
so far , hes ignored me , just the same as he ignored my familys cries for mercy .	1
jesus theres no jesus here .	1
theres only what they turned me into .	1
what they did to me .	1
theres only this .	1
jasmine leaned forward so that he could see her face in the dim light .	1
one side was the jasmine he remembered .	1
beautiful , serene , now with tears streaming freely down her cheek .	1
the other side of her face was an abomination .	1
the acid had seared off her living flesh , blinded her , and so ruined it that it more resembled something that had been dragged down a road for miles , or trapped in a fire , than something human .	1
the tendons and ligaments were exposed and , even two years after the horrific event , it was a suppurating wet sorea picture of hell on earth incarnate .	1
the young man had seen plenty of death and savagery in his life but even he was shocked , and he automatically recoiled from the sight .	1
it was the most horrible thing hed ever seen .	1
he felt his gag reflex triggering as the pit of his stomach dropped out .	1
oh oh god , jasmine there was nothing to say .	1
no words anyone could say to make it better .	1
jasmine had been right .	1
there was no hope .	1
chapter 7 the cantina lights twinkled in the softness of the spring night air ; the bouncing beat of lively banda music floated out from inside , along with raucous laughter and peals of glee from inebriated women .	1
it was saturday night and the party was in full swing on the outskirts of culiacan , a rough and rural area populated by hard men with dead eyes and females who were looking for a fast luxury ride to nowhere .	1
this was cartel country and the bar was a cartel bar , so if you hadnt grown up in the area and didnt know the owners , you didnt go inside unless you had a death wish .	1
it was one of the few places in mexico where armand altamar could let his hair down and relax .	1
he wasnt at war with anyone for the time being so he had little to fear .	1
things were prospering under his iron rule and everyone was making a ton of money since hed taken over most of don miguels duties .	1
hed had to give up some of the meth and heroin traffic to diego up north , and had to cut in aranas , the head of the sinaloa cartel , for a fifteen-percent-larger slice of his cocaine traffic ; but even so , business had grown to the point where he didnt even feel the dilution he was pocketing fifty million dollars a month , on a bad one .	1
not so bad for a forty-year-old ex-enforcer who had come up from the streets , fighting tooth and nail for anything he ever got .	1
hed been born in one of culiacans worst barrios , a desperate den of poverty and filth that few walked away from .	1
now he was running things after someone had taken out the don .	1
it was like a dream come true and he was making the most of it .	1
every weekend , he would hire one of the most popular banda groups in sinaloa to play for his de facto private party at his bar .	1
every friend he had would attend , as well as some of the most beautiful examples of mexican femininity in the country all to pay homage to him and celebrate his success .	1
not that winning the spoils had been easy , by any means .	1
for a few months after the don had passed on to his just reward , culiacan had been a death zone .	1
five or six different factions fought it out for his turf , and the streets had literally run red with their blood .	1
the only way altamar had emerged victorious was through a combination of epic brutality , stealth , deceit and , surprisingly , a willingness to compromise with his rivals .	1
after several of his competitors had been found beheaded , along with their entire families including newborn babies , aged relatives and even household pets the notion of doing a deal to end the madness had been appealing to even the most battle-hardened contenders .	1
and so a cautious truce had gone into effect .	1
the killing stopped , prosperity returned and everyone went back to doing what they were supposed to do : making money a lot of money .	1
maybe not as much as if one man ran it all , as don miguel had , but , then again , more than anyone could spend in a hundred lifetimes , just the same .	1
altamar had introduced the idea that you had to be alive to spend it , and had been utterly ruthless in driving home the point that , unless you cooperated and stepped out of the way , your life wasnt worth anything .	1
over four hundred and seventy people had lost their lives in the two months following the dons passing , at least according to the official count .	1
the actual number was more like double that , many left rotting in hidden fields for the carrion birds to pick apart , or buried in shallow graves .	1
one particularly brutal week , the rivers had been chocked with bodies floating down from the marijuana fields .	1
it finally got to the point where even those accustomed to incredible violence and brutality had been through enough , and so they worked out a truce .	1
hed proved his point .	1
if you crossed him , you , your family , your servants and their families would all be slaughtered without a seconds hesitation .	1
it had been a stunningly effective campaign .	1
by its short but bloody end , he was in charge of a coalition of former rivals who were all still alive to spend their money .	1
true , hed made lifelong enemies due to his tactics , but he wasnt worried .	1
nobody dared move against him .	1
the price of even the slightest thing going wrong was the extermination of everyone you knew , of everything you held precious .	1
the stakes were just too high , so he settled into his position of power with confidence , while always sleeping with one eye open .	1
his entourage were the most dangerous and violent killers in the region ; he made a huge point of advertising that fact .	1
they were men who drank baby blood for breakfast and killed priests over coffee .	1
by cultivating the reputation as the devil walking the earth , hed climbed to the pinnacle of his world ; the view from up top was better than hed ever expected .	1
he had his pick of the most gorgeous young women , he was literally awash with cash and every comfort and toy he desired .	1
he was feared and revered for his ruthlessness and his absolute power .	1
it was as close as you could get to being a demigod .	1
and it was good .	1
tonight , hed been drinking tequila with his cousins , who were never far away from his side .	1
he surrounded himself with family and made sure they also wanted for nothing .	1
blood was their bond , hed repeat over and over when drunk .	1
altamar made sure that they understood he was a hundred percent loyal to his family , and he expected nothing less in return but the same .	1
the threat was as clear as the reward .	1
stick with altamar , and you would live a happy and prosperous life .	1
get it into your head to betray him and hed erase you from the earth .	1
the combination of carrot and stick was highly effective .	1
inside the club , the air was thick with a haze of cigarette and marijuana smoke .	1
the police avoided the building like it was radioactive , so there were no rules when within its four walls , the interior of which were covered with cowboy regalia .	1
lassos , bridles , photos of prize bulls and horses , horseshoes .	1
myriad related paraphernalia adorned every inch of the place , giving it an air of a themed junk shop .	1
booths ringed both of the longer sides of the room , which featured an elaborate stage on one end and a long wooden bar on the opposite .	1
girls in cowboy hats and microscopic jean shorts or miniskirts and cowboy boots weaved their way between the small circular tables that cluttered half the floor the remainder of which was left to the many dancers .	1
the fifteen-piece band barely fitted on the stage but neither the musicians nor the celebrants seemed to mind as the caterwauling of the dissonant horn section battled with the strident tenor of the singer , who was belting out a song begging apology for a series of indiscretions with other women ; because this time , hed be faithful due to having changed .	1
straw was scattered about the floor in an effort to create a more authentically rustic experience .	1
the overall tone of the establishment was a rowdy rural roadhouse , albeit fifteen minutes from the edge of a cosmopolitan city of over a million in population .	1
most of the men wore jeans or slacks with cowboy boots and hats ; their female companions wore little but smiles , their modesty cloaked by strategically-donned tops that struggled to contain their charms , with shorts or pants that looked like theyd been sprayed on .	1
many of the girls were in their late teens to early twenties with a fair mix of professionals and those looking to find a generous narcotraficante sugar daddy .	1
it was a playground for men who lived at breakneck speed , for whom the light of tomorrow was not guaranteed , and who denied themselves nothing .	1
outside the building , four discreetly armed men loitered a few feet from the entrance , providing the obligatory muscle should anyone be so foolhardy as to interrupt the fiesta with unpleasantness .	1
they were in their mid-twenties , with a palpable air of menace and dispositions that indicated their willingness to kill you just as readily as bum a smoke .	1
two were ex-marines , the other two survivors of a lifetime on the street the four of them had tallied between themselves at least ten times their number in killings .	1
the area around the club was dense brush that had been cleared to create the mammoth dirt parking lot .	1
a custom-built neon sign atop a metal column blinked the image of a highly-stylized devil wearing a cowboy hat and leering suggestively at new arrivals , its oscillating illumination lending a carnival air to the tightly parked cars .	1
occasionally , another vehicle would pull off the main road and brave the hundred yards to the club , headlights briefly shining on the front of the establishment before finding a spot among the rest of the patrons .	1
inside , altamar slammed his fist down on the scarred table-top of his favorite booth , having just finished telling another tale of one of his conquests , and threw back his head and laughed with delight .	1
the girls on either side of him were all smiles .	1
another round of tequila and beer hastily arrived , altamar having waved down a waitress moments earlier .	1
the service staff didnt need to ask what kind it was always the same .	1
negra modelo and cazadores .	1
altamar liked the familiar , and he was a veritable drinking machine every friday and saturday night .	1
his cousins invariably struggled to keep up with him as the hour got late , which deterred him not one iota .	1
hed be having a private party later with the pair of youthful minxes accompanying him .	1
his two cousins eyed him with envious admiration even as their vision began to blur .	1
they had their own girls , but not much was going to be happening by the end of the night , when theyd fall dazed into bed with the room spinning while their companions did their best to entertain them .	1
altamar , on the other hand , had a reputation for being insatiable , more than likely helped by the plentiful chemical supplementation he lavished upon himself .	1
he looked around after delivering the hysterically funny punch-line to his latest story , and delivered it again , louder , for emphasis .	1
no doubt it would be even funnier the second time .	1
so i tell the fucker , what , you think youre superman ?	1
all right , asshole , so youll have no problem flying .	1
and then i threw him off the roof of the building .	1
you know , in the end , he didnt fly so good !	1
he pounded the table again , killing himself with his wit .	1
his company tittered drunkenly , the girls beaming toothy smiles , but he quickly lost interest in the ladies as nature called .	1
altamar stood up unsteadily and , after stabilizing himself with the table , woozily moved to the rear of the club , where he had an office with a private restroom .	1
he grappled with his keys and unlocked the door before entering and turning the deadbolt , ensuring he wouldnt be interrupted while conducting his important business .	1
altamar flicked on the overhead light and leaned against the wall for a second , as though the act of walking forty yards had sapped his energy .	1
maybe hed had too much tequila too fast , he thought , and then he stumbled over to his desk , slid the center drawer open and extracted a small vial .	1
he fiddled with the top , and after tearing it free tapped out two fat lines of cocaine on the glass desktop .	1
he rolled up a hundred dollar bill and snorted them with gusto , wincing at the delicious burn as the drug hit his septum .	1
augmentation complete , he moved to the bathroom and opened the door .	1
he failed to notice the shadow in the dark room or the quiet rustle before excruciating pain lanced through his head and everything went dark .	1
fifteen minutes later , his cousins realized that altamar had been gone a long time and staggered back to the office to check on him .	1
the door was locked , which wasnt unexpected .	1
the men pounded on it , calling to him .	1
after getting no response to multiple efforts , they went and found two of altamars security detail , who swiftly broke the door down , guns drawn .	1
the office was pitch black .	1
when they turned on the lights , they were confronted with an empty room .	1
the most sober of the cousins went to the window and pulled the blinds up , then yelled at the two guards , pointing at the opening .	1
three of the iron bars over the window had been cut , either with a welding torch or some sort of acid , and were bent out at right angles , creating a space just large enough for a body to fit through .	1
the music stopped two minutes later .	1
the fiesta was abruptly terminated .	1
armed men milled about , uncertain as to what to do until the cousin who had discovered the window issued instructions and they raced for their vehicles .	1
altamar faded in and out of consciousness , unsure what was happening to him .	1
he was bouncing against a hard surface , felt cool air blowing over him and a sense of motion .	1
he struggled to move but his wrists and ankles were bound and he had tape over his mouth .	1
he opened his eyes wider but couldnt make anything out ; something was blocking his vision .	1
his arm hurt in the upper bicep like hed been shot , and the last thought he had as he faded again was that someone had injected him with something to knock him out .	1
eventually , altamar returned to full awareness and this time he could see , albeit without much clarity .	1
he blinked his eyes in a futile effort to clear his head , which was splitting from the blow .	1
he tried to reach up to touch the tender spot and discovered that he could only move his arm a few inches from where it was extended slightly above shoulder level .	1
he tried the other arm , also extended , and met with the same resistance .	1
now fully alert , his respiration increased and he was flooded with a sense of panic .	1
when he tried to move his legs , he encountered the same problem he was immobilized , spread-eagled , his arms and legs stretched wide .	1
his nose registered the musty odor of long-abandoned horse stalls , and when his vision returned to near normal , he could see that he was indeed in an old barn , chained to the floor .	1
he continued to struggle for a few minutes until blood began tricking from his wrists where hed torn most of the skin off from pulling against the chains .	1
dim light came from a pair of headlights outside the closed barn door , where slim illumination crept through from around the sides and the base .	1
altamar screamed , more a hoarse croak than anything , largely due to the effects on his vocal cords of whatever hed been dosed with .	1
he paused after several seconds and heard a sound from the far end of the space .	1
he was able to move his head and crane his neck and he saw a young man dressed entirely in black turn to face him from the area by the stalls .	1
the young man sauntered over unhurriedly and smiled humorlessly at altamar , causing his breath to catch in his throat and his blood to run cold .	1
he knew that look , and knew what it meant .	1
he needed to take the initiative or this could get far worse .	1
you fucking cocksucker .	1
ill cut your balls off and force you to eat them in front of me .	1
do you have any idea who i am ?	1
altamar rasped at him .	1
a good defense was often a strong offense .	1
the young man smiled again , almost blithely , and without responding , opened the barn door and sauntered out to the truck that was parked outside , returning after a few minutes with a lit kerosene lantern .	1
he placed it carefully on a stall ledge so it brightened the area where altamar was chained and went back to the truck , extinguishing its headlights and shutting off the motor .	1
altamar heard the mans footsteps grow louder and then he was blinded by a blue-white flash .	1
his vision gradually returned , and he was blinded by another .	1
the young man was taking photographs of him .	1
a spike of fear ran through altamar .	1
he decided to try a different approach .	1
im very , very rich .	1
i can get you whatever you want , eh ?	1
anything .	1
how much money do you want ?	1
whats it going to take ?	1
altamar sensed that threats werent going to have any effect , so hed appeal to greed , which was a constant in all humans .	1
it wasnt a question of if , it was a matter of how much .	1
the man just smiled again , shaking his head as if dealing with a child .	1
did you hear me ?	1
i can get you anything .	1
millions of dollars .	1
in cash .	1
whats your number ?	1
what do you want ?	1
a million ?	1
two million ?	1
fine .	1
i can get you two million dollars with a phone call .	1
the young man considered the idea , and then nodded .	1
i think id like to be a millionaire .	1
that sounds like it would be fun .	1
so you get me two million dollars , and then once i have the money and im safe , ill release you .	1
ill unlock your chains , and youll be free to go .	1
you dont know me , so im not worried about being found by your thugs .	1
how do we do this ?	1
the young man asked .	1
now youre thinking .	1
in my pocket .	1
i have a phone .	1
get it for me , and ill give you a number to call .	1
let me talk , and well set up getting you your money .	1
but how ?	1
how will i get the money and know im safe , and that your men arent watching me or following me ?	1
he asked .	1
we can do it like ive done some of my deals .	1
we pick a remote location youre familiar with .	1
at a predetermined time , a man will come and put a bag with the money wherever you like , and then leave .	1
you wait as long as you want , and then retrieve the money .	1
its a standard drop .	1
we do it all the time , altamar explained .	1
ah .	1
good thinking .	1
i think i can improve on that .	1
i have an idea that will work .	1
and then he explained what he wanted .	1
altamars eyes widened .	1
very smart .	1
ive never heard of anything like that before .	1
i see what youre trying to do .	1
it will be impossible to follow you that way .	1
okay , make the call .	1
we have a deal .	1
you get your money , you unchain me and let me go , right ?	1
im a man of my word .	1
how will i know youll do as you say ?	1
i went to a lot of trouble to get you out alive .	1
if id wanted to kill you , youd have been dead an hour ago .	1
i want something else .	1
so make the call , and lets get this over with , the young man replied .	1
altamars features clouded something about the interaction was off .	1
he didnt know what , but he didnt believe his captor .	1
you know what ?	1
fuck you .	1
i think youre lying , and youre going to kill me anyway , he hissed .	1
fair enough .	1
i guess ill kill you now .	1
and youll never find out if you were wrong .	1
the young man shrugged , apparently uninterested in which way the transaction went .	1
from the back of his pants , he pulled a semi-automatic pistol and approached altamar .	1
the drug lord struggled to maintain his composure , but his eyes widened at the sight of the gun .	1
wait .	1
heres my proposal .	1
you get the two million , but you hand me over in exchange for the money when you get it .	1
the young man smiled again with genuine amusement .	1
i must not be very convincing , or you must be very stupid .	1
this isnt a negotiation .	1
you either give me two million dollars on my terms , and i release you , or you fuck around and i blow your brains out .	1
or maybe i gut shoot you and watch you lie in your own shit and blood for a few hours while you beg me to end the agony .	1
he considered that mental image .	1
you really think im going to let your men pick me off with a sniper rifle the second youre safe ?	1
im disappointed .	1
i was sure you were smarter than that .	1
maybe ill blow your kneecaps off , and youll be walking around on prosthetic limbs for the rest of your miserable life , just so you know im serious .	1
do you need me to do that ?	1
show you im serious ?	1
altamar hesitated , calculating , and then his shoulders slumped .	1
no .	1
i believe you .	1
fine .	1
well do it your way .	1
make the call .	1
the young man dialed the number altamar gave him , and then held the phone up to the ear of the cartel kingpin .	1
when the other end of the line answered , altamar explained hed been kidnapped , but that it was okay , and to gather two million in cash and have it ready to go at four a.m. in two more hours .	1
he then gave instructions on how it was to be delivered .	1
altamar had many millions in cash stashed in multiple places in town , so getting two million was the least of his problems .	1
altamar listened to the response and then barked angrily into the phone .	1
dont argue with me .	1
just do it .	1
my life is at stake here .	1
do it precisely as i explained , and dont fuck around or try anything clever .	1
i dont want to die because you got smart , altamar warned , before the young man terminated the call and pocketed the phone .	1
all right .	1
i did my part .	1
so now you go get your money , and then you let me go .	1
you better move a long way away from here , because its not going to be very healthy for you after this , you know ?	1
altamar couldnt resist the threat .	1
he had a good sense for people , and he believed that the young man would release him .	1
i dont intend to stay very long .	1
now , if youll excuse me , i have some things to attend to , the young man apologized , turning to leave .	1
altamar was startled by a sound of scurrying from out of his field of vision , above his head .	1
what the fuck ?	1
whats that ?	1
he hissed .	1
that ?	1
oh , thats probably the rats , i expect .	1
i remember the place was infested with them last time i was here , the young man said conversationally .	1
rats ?	1
then you cant leave me here on the ground .	1
get me up , altamar demanded .	1
the young man appeared to consider it .	1
no , youll stay where you are .	1
besides , youll soon have bigger things to think about than a few pesky rats , he reasoned , and moved to grab the bottle hed placed on the ground near the door .	1
whats that ?	1
altamar asked , his voice catching .	1
youll know soon enough .	1
i wanted to leave you something to reflect upon while im off picking up my money .	1
you may not remember , but you hurt someone i care deeply about and im here to return the favor .	1
that was why i wanted you alive , although once you made the offer of the money , i felt it would be poor manners to turn it down , the young man explained , carefully unscrewing the top of the glass bottle .	1
altamar stared up at him , horrified , as the young man approached .	1
he renewed his struggle against the chains .	1
no .	1
you promised youd let me go , altamar protested .	1
i did .	1
and i will .	1
but i never promised youd want to be let go , he said , and then poured a small amount of the acid on the cartel boss face , careful to avoid splashing any on his own clothes or shoes .	1
altamars skin began to bubble and smoke , and his eyes immediately ulcerated as the fluid seared through the lids .	1
altamars agonized shrieks were bloodcurdling , but had no effect on the young man .	1
they were in the middle of nowhere , the big house abandoned and jasmines home a quarter mile away .	1
there was no one to hear the screams , which gradually died as some acid entered his mouth and cauterized his tongue and throat .	1
the young man resealed the bottle and placed it on the stall next to the lantern , and then turned , unbuckling his pants .	1
id rape your sorry ass as well , but im afraid id catch something .	1
so instead , ill leave you to the rats .	1
theyll come soon enough , he disclosed as he urinated on altamars face , rinsing off most of the acid so the man would remain alive .	1
he wanted the agony to last as long as possible , and he didnt want the scumbag to get off lightly by dying after a few minutes of unspeakable pain .	1
ill be back after i get the money you so generously offered .	1
i should have held out for five , but since its not about the money , two is more than enough no point in being greedy , and it would be harder to carry .	1
when i get back , if the rats have left anything of you , ill release you just as i promised .	1
without a face , but then again , youve done as bad or worse , so you cant really complain , he reasoned .	1
altamar gurgled , choking .	1
it was now hard to tell given the condition of what had been his face , but the young man thought he might be choking , the acid having removed his nose along with most of his skin and tendons .	1
he reached into his back pocket and withdrew a pocket knife , which he opened as he approached the drug boss .	1
kneeling down , he stabbed it into the mans windpipe just above his clavicle , and then stepped back to study the wound .	1
blood frothed forth , and he turned and trotted out to the truck , returning a few seconds later with a pen .	1
he used his teeth to pull out the ballpoint mechanism , leaving a slender tube , which he first blew through , and then jabbed through the bloody opening .	1
he listened attentively , and was rewarded with the sound of air moving in and out through the pen , albeit labored breathing but beggars couldnt be choosers .	1
there .	1
youll live .	1
although youll wish you hadnt .	1
ill be taking the lantern .	1
the rats seem to prefer the dark for their work .	1
they seem emboldened by the night .	1
have a nice rest , he said , and then grabbed the light and walked out of the barn , taking care to shut the door securely behind him .	1
the big ford lobo engine started , and the last thing altamar registered as the wheels crunched on the gravel outside was the sound of the exhaust disappearing in the distance .	1
then the rats came .	1
chapter 8 a green ford explorer pulled into the darkened lot of the little restaurant .	1
a man got out , carrying a backpack with two million dollars in it , carefully sealed in ziploc freezer bags .	1
after surveying the road and verifying he was alone , he swung the rear of the suv open and withdrew an inflated tire inner tube .	1
he strapped the backpack securely to the tire using two bungee cords and stuck a cheap plastic flashlight into the exterior flap of the bag , the lens sticking out partway .	1
he gingerly carried the ensemble down the banks to the edge of the canal rosales , and scanning the area again , flicked the switch on the flashlight before putting the inner tube on the waters surface and pushing it out towards the middle of the moving current .	1
he watched as it floated slowly away from him to the middle of the fifty-foot-wide canal , the little light bobbing as it made its way downstream .	1
once it was out of sight , he returned to his truck and drove away .	1
the young man spied on him from a hundred yards downstream through binoculars , noting the passage of the floating treasure as it moved slowly by him , and watched the mans tail lights disappear down the road .	1
once he was satisfied that he was alone he ran down the overgrown bank as far as he could make it , before diving into the canal .	1
within a few minutes his powerful strokes had carried him downstream , and he caught up to the tire .	1
he switched off the flashlight so he would be completely invisible in the dark , moonless night .	1
he made for the shore , and once close began moving against the current to a concrete embankment hed drifted forty yards beyond .	1
after reaching the bank he exited the chilly water , pausing to remove the backpack from the contrivance before lashing the flashlight back in place on the tube , switching it back on , and pushing it out into the stream again , on the off chance theyd been stupid enough to position someone further downstream at the bridge that spanned the canal a quarter mile away .	1
he moved into the brush and located his black army boots exactly where hed left them , with a change of dry clothes .	1
he quickly stripped off his soaking black t-shirt and pants and wrung them out before stuffing them into the bag with the cash .	1
after slipping into another black shirt and a pair of jeans , he pulled his boots on and was ready to move within two minutes .	1
he edged silently through the brush and found the path at the end of which hed left the truck , and debated his next move .	1
there was more to attend to .	1
hed need to keep his word and deal with altamar .	1
he started the engine , and then had a thought so evil it surprised even him .	1
there was a sense of poetic justice to it , really .	1
he put the big truck in gear and pulled off into the night , tapping his fingers to the faint latin rock beat playing on the radio .	1
so this was what it was like to be rich .	1
sort of cold and wet , but it would do .	1
by the time he made it back to the barn it was five-thirty in the morning , and dawn would be shining its rays onto the valley within forty-five minutes .	1
he wanted to make short work of his remaining chores , so he sprang from the truck and moved to the barn entrance , carrying the lantern with him as he whistled a happy tune .	1
when he opened the door he was greeted by angry squeaking from a mass of rats that were feeding on altamar , most of which scurried away in fear when he swung the lantern at them .	1
he inspected the feared cartel chiefs ravaged torso and face , checking for signs of breathing , and was rewarded by his chest laboring to draw air through the tube .	1
he shook his head it was truly amazing that hed made it .	1
the scumbag had the constitution of an ox .	1
the young man crouched down , unlocked the padlocks that secured the chains on the drug lords feet and hands , and left them by his side .	1
he stood , surveying the barns interior , and saw that there was still abundant desiccated hay on the floor .	1
altamar emitted a groaning sound from where his mouth had been , but where now there were merely gums and teeth , his lips having been neatly removed by the acidand then the rats .	1
the young man fished the camera out again and took another photo , ensuring that the time stamp wasnt on .	1
im back .	1
a deals a deal .	1
i released you .	1
i think that its a safe bet that with a mug like that you wont be doing the cover shot for telenoticias any time soon , but maybe you can get some part-time work scaring kids for halloween .	1
youre free to go , so thanks for the memories and have a nice life .	1
oh , and i know youll need some light given the condition of whats left of your eyes , so ill be a nice guy and leave the lantern burning for you .	1
hope you make it out before the fire gets out of control .	1
thats got to be a horrible way to die , the young man said in a kind , soft voice , before tossing the lantern against the ground and watching the kerosene splatter onto the dry hay from its broken reservoir .	1
the fire immediately spread and began to roar , and soon the entire barn was ablaze .	1
inspecting his work with quiet satisfaction , the young man spun and walked to the door , pausing to kick altamar in the groin as he moved past him .	1
it wouldnt do to have the filthy parasite passing out .	1
hed want his full attention for this phase of what remained of his short life .	1
the fire licked from the barn door and windows as he started the trucks engine .	1
after a few moments it was obvious that altamar wasnt going to make it out .	1
a shame , really .	1
it would almost be better if he somehow managed to survive .	1
a life in that mangled condition would be fitting punishment for what hed done to jasmine and her family .	1
but a deal was a deal , and hed kept his word .	1
he slid the transmission into reverse and pulled away .	1
there was nothing left to see .	1
the truck approached the small house and rolled to a stop , the engine going silent as the driver-side door opened .	1
the young man moved to the homes entrance and expertly picked the lock .	1
once inside , he crept soundlessly to the main bedroom , where jasmine was sleeping .	1
hed been tortured since hed seen her face .	1
even after getting revenge for the vicious brutality , he knew her life was going to continue to be a miserable nightmare .	1
nobody could help her .	1
hed gladly leave her the two million dollars if he thought for a second that medicine could fix her face to anything resembling normalcy , but he knew that was an impossibility .	1
it was just another example of a cruel and unpredictable universe punishing the innocents and making their every moment a tortured farce .	1
he watched as she lay , breathing fitfully , her ravaged profile a constant reminder of the pain shed endured , and then he pulled his pistol from his belt and shot her in the head .	1
ten minutes later he sat on the hood of the truck , watching the house burn , embers blowing into the pre-dawn as they carried his jasmines soul with them .	1
he reasoned that if there was such thing as hell , he would be going anyway , so he was more than willing to carry the burden of ending her suffering and doing what she couldnt do for herself .	1
he winced as the roof collapsed , the propane for the stove having provided ample fuel to get the blaze started .	1
a single tear trickled its way down his cheek his lonely offering to a world that brutalized its children and savaged its meek .	1
his shoulders shuddered as he cried for what could have been , and what jasmine could have had , at the unfairness of it all and the pointlessness of everything .	1
eventually , his sorrow exhausted , he gruffly rubbed the moisture from his face with his shirt sleeve before getting behind the wheel and driving away .	1
there was still much to be done , and he could bemoan his existence later .	1
solomon valiente sat in the office of his furniture store , ranchero music humming forth from the showroom speakers in an attempt to lure pedestrians in , wondering what the gimmick was in this overture from an unknown .	1
hed gotten a strange call an hour earlier indicating that a stranger wanted to speak with him on an important matter of urgency .	1
he rubbed his neck , absently fingering the heavy gold links that held the crucifix he never removed .	1
he gestured to the two men standing by his door to allow the young man to enter his office .	1
valiente was one of the main rivals to altamars iron hold on his empire , and it was well known that he hated the drug lord , furious over some close family members who had been killed by altamars goons when the power struggle over don miguels holdings was underway .	1
in the interests of prosperity theyd made their fragile pact , but valiente held a grudge , and he was a dangerous and powerful adversary in his own right .	1
the young man had approached him through a street-level enforcer that morning and requested a meeting .	1
he claimed to have something of tremendous value to offer valiente , which had naturally piqued his interest valiente was a man best avoided , so he wasnt accustomed to being solicited for anything .	1
three security men had frisked the young man upon his arrival , verifying that he had no weapons and wasnt wearing a wire before allowing him near valientes office ; so there could be no trickery or immediate physical threat always a concern in the cartel game , where you could routinely expect attempts on your life on virtually any pretense .	1
valiente leaned forward in his reclining chair as the young man entered and sat in one of the two chairs in front of his desk , a stern , armed enforcer bracketing him on either side , ever mindful of the slightest wrong move .	1
so , you want a meeting .	1
here it is .	1
tell me what it is you have thats of such value to me , valiente started , sipping his coffee while appraising the young mans face .	1
im an ex-marine .	1
i want to begin a career as a specialist in contract executions for your cartel .	1
ive been trained in every sort of weapons and demolition , and i have a years worth of combat experience with over thirty-six confirmed kills , the young man began .	1
thats interesting , but its not of that much value to me .	1
dont get me wrong , i can always use good men , but theres a difference between coming looking for a job , and bringing me something of value , valiente observed .	1
i know .	1
and im not looking for a job .	1
im offering my services as a contractor .	1
and what i have to offer you , i believe , is significant .	1
as a good faith token , take a look at this .	1
it was taken seven hours ago .	1
he removed the small digital camera from his pants pocket , powered it on and thumbed through the photos until he reached the desired one .	1
he handed the device to valiente .	1
valiente peered at the screen and blinked , and then his eyes narrowed , taking on a vaguely reptilian cast .	1
both of you .	1
get out , he instructed his bodyguards .	1
the two hulking men exchanged glances , and then with distrustful glares at the new arrival , obediently left the room .	1
i could have you killed for this , and altamar would reward me with anything i wanted .	1
no .	1
he wouldnt .	1
he cant give you what you really want .	1
only i can .	1
today .	1
because you dont want to live in his shadow forever , and i have the ability to make him disappear , now , and never give you any more problems .	1
you and you alone would know he was gone , enabling you to consolidate power and take steps ahead of any of your competitors , ensuring that youd replace him .	1
heres what i propose .	1
you pay me three hundred thousand dollars and he disappears effective immediately .	1
valientes eyes tracked the young mans unblinking gaze as he spoke .	1
you pay me two hundred thousand dollars each for as many of your rivals you want dispatched within the next seventy-two hours , and ill make it so .	1
its a guarantee that you will take over altamars business at that point , which will make you that amount of money in a matter of minutes .	1
i have him right now , so you havent attempted anything .	1
i have .	1
as i see it , you have nothing to lose and everything to gain .	1
the young man had spoken in a calm , soft voice , with measured inflection , laying out the options in a methodical manner .	1
valiente sank back into his plush chair and considered the proposition while eying the young man .	1
he weighed the options and then rose .	1
if you can do this , we have a deal .	1
what payment do you propose ?	1
the three hundred i want now , and before the days end i will bring you a photo of your enemy dead .	1
the others , half up front , half upon successful completion .	1
its actually a bargain , but im anxious to make a name for myself and earn your support , the young man said .	1
valiente nodded .	1
it was indeed a bargain .	1
they both knew it .	1
he was being handed the keys to the kingdom for a song .	1
i have to say , this comes as a complete surprise .	1
if you can pull this off , youll be very , very busy carrying out jobs for me .	1
valiente stared into his empty cup .	1
and what is your name ?	1
what shall i call you , my young mystery killer who comes bearing gifts ?	1
the young man didnt hesitate .	1
hed already decided on his professional moniker .	1
he would be named after the cursed card that had ruined his life , and had freed him at the same time .	1
el rey .	1
after the tarot card , the king of swords .	1
you can call me el rey .	1
chapter 9 later that evening , after catching a few hours of sleep , el rey returned to valiente with the photo of altamar after the acid facial scrub , having collected his fee before departing the office earlier in the day .	1
the cartel boss was both fascinated and repelled by the after image of altamar and this was a man who saw death on an almost daily basis .	1
jesus christ .	1
what did you do to him ?	1
valiente exclaimed .	1
el rey shrugged .	1
acid .	1
damn , kid .	1
youre one sick bastard , ill grant you that .	1
i never want to piss you off , valiente admitted .	1
i figured youd want something that would make a statement .	1
you can download the photo or i can e-mail it to you for circulation purposes if anyone ever decides to test your power .	1
i imagine it would deliver a considerable deterrent value , el rey said .	1
this will stop anyone that doesnt have a death wish in their tracks .	1
valiente slid a folder to him , along with a black garbage bag .	1
i have three primary rivals i need executed in the next two days .	1
their details are in the folder .	1
half the money for the first contract is in the sack .	1
come back when youve done the first one and ill pay you the balance and give you a payment for the second and third contracts .	1
but i need this handled quickly , because once they get wise to altamar being missing for any significant period of time theyll be coming for me .	1
then i better get going .	1
i could use some help locating a few things for the jobs , though .	1
i figure youd know where to find these .	1
he handed valiente a small piece of notepaper .	1
the sooner i can get them , the sooner i can fulfill these contracts .	1
valiente studied the precisely detailed list .	1
the m4 is no problem .	1
weve got a bunch of those .	1
dont know if any have a night scope on them , though .	1
let me make a call .	1
the remington we also have , or can get within a few hours .	1
same for the beretta with a silencer .	1
pretty standard issue , that .	1
valiente looked up from the list and el rey nodded approvingly .	1
lot of the marines bring those remington 700s with them they love their sniper rifles .	1
i see youre okay with the .308 .	1
that will make it easy .	1
oh , and plastique and grenades ?	1
how messy do you plan to make this ?	1
i dont want to be associated with public bloodbaths in crowds .	1
you need to be surgical .	1
i intend to be as discreet as possible , but its better to be prepared , than not .	1
for now , ill get busy on the first contract while you source that gear .	1
how can i contact you at night ?	1
ill want to pick up the weapons as soon as you have them .	1
valiente scribbled a cell number on the back of a card .	1
call me in two hours and well arrange a drop-off .	1
dont worry about the cost ; theyre on me .	1
im presuming youll want , what , five hundred rounds for the m4 and maybe fifty for the remington and the beretta ?	1
valiente confirmed .	1
el rey nodded .	1
make it a hundred for the beretta .	1
valiente grunted .	1
he was already imagining how it would feel to be sitting on altamars throne .	1
okay , then , were set .	1
and you , my friend , can call me any time .	1
he looked at the image on the little camera again .	1
im glad youre on my side el rey .	1
so am i .	1
both men smiled , any humor never reaching their eyes .	1
el rey had checked into a high-end hotel in town and now sat at the small rectangular table in his room going over the details of the three targets .	1
he didnt see a problem taking them out but it would get progressively harder as word of a purge spread .	1
ideally , he would do all in the same night but the logistics wouldnt accommodate that , and he reconciled himself that hed be lucky to get two , with the third on the schedule for the following day .	1
he jotted the addresses down and decided to go for a drive to reconnoiter the neighborhoods and see what he would be dealing with .	1
valiente had supplied plentiful information on the targets security , so there would hopefully be no surprises there , but he wanted to determine if there was anything valiente had missed .	1
he would need a different vehicle than the truck , so he would have to buy something , preferably with an alarm and dependable , considering that he would be driving around with over two million in cash .	1
it was a thursday evening , so he headed to the part of town where all the new car dealers had lots , before they closed .	1
some lucky salesman was about to get a dream handed to him .	1
el rey drove to the toyota dealer , and after an hour emerged with the keys to a shiny new black 4 runner with a factory alarm .	1
that would more than do .	1
he could do the reconnaissance in the plate-less toyota and then use the big ford for the actual hits .	1
his days with the ford were numbered in hours , so it would be best to use it , rather than the toyota , for operational purposes .	1
he drove to the first targets ranch in a neighborhood on the outskirts of town , five acres with a nice colonial-style single-level house , a modest seven bedrooms per the information hed been given .	1
he knew from the photos and the file what to expect on the layout , and found several obvious holes in the security setup just driving by .	1
the first target , manuel remarosa , would be a piece of cake .	1
the second hit wouldnt be so easy , he knew .	1
the man lived an hour outside of culiacan on a large parcel of land with only one entry a heavily guarded private road .	1
there was no point in driving out there before he picked up the weapons , so he returned to the hotel and called valiente , who confirmed he had everything .	1
they agreed to meet in half an hour at a restaurant in town and the hand-off went uneventfully .	1
valientes security men kept a watchful eye out for threats as they chatted over a snack , before el rey transferred the golf-bag with the weapons in it to the lobo .	1
after heading out to look at the second and third targets homes , he confirmed his instinct that he could only do two of the three that night , at best , and modified his strategy accordingly .	1
by the time he made it back to the hotel it was ten at night and he was tired , so after checking the weapons and loading them , he took a two hour cat-nap .	1
the slumber did him a world of good , and by one a.m. he was parked a quarter mile from manuel remarosas opulent home .	1
he would use the beretta and the m4 for this exercise , and hoped hed be able to get in and out without having to fire the assault rifle .	1
the pistol would be relatively silent ; but opening up with an automatic rifle would draw considerable undesired attention .	1
el rey was dressed from head to toe in dark gray army-surplus camouflage , nearly invisible as he slid silently through the brush on the periphery of the estate .	1
he could make out the silhouettes of the armed guards sitting at their assigned points near the primary entry areas , but even so , he didnt anticipate any problems getting in and out .	1
the one out on the breakfast patio was out of sight of the rest , so he was the weak link .	1
el reys plan was to neutralize the man and then simply walk into the house , make his way to the targets bedroom and do the deed .	1
it would be over in no time , before the gunmen had any idea what had happened .	1
the hurdle was how to cross the expanse of open space between the brush and the house without being detected .	1
hed need to time it perfectly so as to avoid getting into a firefight .	1
this kind of spur of the moment operation depended entirely on the element of surprise .	1
he preferred to plan his future hits carefully but hed been handed the means by which to begin his career with a bang , so hed do what needed to be done on these .	1
the problem was that , as he watched the house , he couldnt see any means to reach it without alarming the guard and bringing the full wrath of four armed men down on him .	1
it sucked , but he would need to modify his plan to reflect reality .	1
hed thought that one of the angles would keep him hidden until he was almost right on the guard , but once he was in the brush he discovered that was illusory .	1
calculating his next move , he hunkered down to wait , figuring it would be a long night .	1
manuel remarosa stretched on his four poster bed , and rolled over so that the morning light from the window wouldnt wake him up anymore than he already was .	1
sadie , his golden retriever , had other ideas and , hearing her master shift on the bed , decided it was time to send him a message of undying love in the form of sloppy wet kisses on his face .	1
she jumped up onto the mattress between manuel and his wife , gloria , and firmly deposited herself , lavishing her beloved master with affection .	1
manuel swatted at her halfheartedly before rolling over again towards the window , resigned to his fate .	1
he couldnt really get too angry with sadie shed been sleeping on the bed with him since a tiny puppy of six weeks , and it was only since she turned one year old a few months ago and was now an adult that shed been relegated to the terracotta tile of the floor .	1
she loves you , amor .	1
and youre the one who wanted a dog , gloria murmured from her position on the bed , her voice thick with sleep .	1
i know , i know .	1
dont get up .	1
ill take her out for a little exercise , manuel replied sarcastically .	1
gloria ignored the jab , already drifting back to dreamland .	1
manuel slid his slippers on and trundled across the floor to the bathroom , sadie locked to his side in anticipation of going for a walk .	1
he stood at the toilet going about his business , sadie obediently waiting for him on the other side of the threshold to the forbidden area , and yawned loudly , stretching his arms over his head and finishing by rubbing his hand across the coarse stubble on his cheeks .	1
he was fat , he knew , but not dangerously so ; maybe forty or fifty pounds .	1
but he could always lose it that was his daily mantra before going for a half-hearted morning jog , which inevitably terminated with a huge breakfast loaded with cholesterol , carbs and cheese .	1
manuel scratched his bottom as he considered shaving , then decided hed forego that chore today .	1
he entered the huge walk-in closet and donned his workout outfit a green america soccer tunic and basketball shorts before turning to sadie , whose eyes twinkled with anticipation .	1
who wants to go for a walk ?	1
he asked innocently .	1
sadie danced back and forth , her tail whipping the air in a frenzy , doing everything in her power to convey to her master that it was she , indeed , that wanted to do so .	1
if only i could find someone who wanted to go for a walk !	1
manuel exclaimed , and sadie began whining as she pranced in the doorway , occasionally leaping into the air and twirling completely around in a canine display of balletic prowess .	1
manuel decided to give the dog a break and not torture her any more , although he knew she enjoyed the buildup as much as he enjoyed her reaction .	1
together , they moved to the bedroom door and made their way down the hall , a wholly unlikely pair .	1
he stopped in the kitchen and greeted maria , their cook , who was already simmering something heavenly-smelling on the expansive viking stove top .	1
whats that ?	1
he asked .	1
machaca , don remarosa , she replied softly .	1
maria was sixty , from los mochis , north of culiacan on the sea of cortez , and was a remarkably talented cook .	1
shed been with him for a quarter of his forty years , and he still looked forward to her meals every day .	1
make sure its low fat .	1
remember im on a diet , he chided , rubbing his ample belly with a grin .	1
always , don remarosa , maria assured him .	1
manuel was a brutal killer who had executed twenty competitors over his two decades of ascending the cartel ladder in sinaloa , but he loved his mother , his four children , his dog , his wife and his two mistresses .	1
and marias cooking .	1
it never occurred to him to question his lifestyle hed come up from the streets , where hed started out as a collector for one of don aranas cells , and had worked his way up to his current position as one of altamars trusted lieutenants , and was now making ten million dollars every year .	1
this , for a boy from the slums who had terminated his education at the age of twelve to live by his wits on the streets of culiacan .	1
the cartel game had made him a rich man , and he wanted for nothing .	1
if he had to get his hands dirty , so be it .	1
hed murdered his first man when he was thirteen , using a bread knife , and had never looked back .	1
his life had been relatively tranquil under the reign of his new boss , and he had hardly had to kill anyone so far this year an anomaly for the business .	1
it was a time of peace , and he was happy to be reaping the rewards of altamars rule .	1
he still remembered the bad time a few years back when don miguel had been executed , the streets running red with blood .	1
hed had to pack his family and send them off to lake chapala during the worst of it .	1
for months , hed lived like a terrorist commander , hiding for his life in different anonymous locations as he waged a guerilla war against his competitors each day .	1
it was like anything else , he supposed .	1
there were good times and the not so good times .	1
it wasnt perfect , but then again , nobody got rich in mexico without getting bloody .	1
hed made his choices and had prevailed .	1
he couldnt complain .	1
manuel lumbered to the entry door with sadie springing alongside him and stepped outside to the crisp air of a bright new morning .	1
he loved this time of day .	1
it was cool enough so you werent sweating through your clothes , and the rainy season hadnt started yet .	1
spring was a perfect time to live in sinaloa , and he relished the season with the joy of an alcoholic with a full bottle .	1
his morning shift of bodyguards was dutifully waiting outside for him , two of them on all terrain vehicles , with their weapons cradled in their laps , ready for the jog at whatever time it would begin .	1
hola , chicos .	1
you up for another good one ?	1
manuel greeted his men .	1
no reply answered him .	1
none was expected .	1
these werent his friends , no matter how warm and fuzzy the don acted , and they understood their role was to protect him , not chat with him .	1
sadie whined and nudged his hand with her nose , anxious to get underway .	1
manuel began stretching , using the columns of his porch for support , smiling at his beloved dog barely more than a puppy .	1
searing lances of white hot pain shot through his upper-body as his chest exploded .	1
blood splattered sadie and his men as the burst of gunfire from the brush pounded into his torso .	1
the men froze momentarily before taking cover wherever they could , shooting haphazardly at the area where the gunfire had come from .	1
the two on atvs gunned their motors and went tearing off in the direction of the sniper , until first one and then the others head exploded , the vehicles slowing and turning aimlessly now that their operators were dead .	1
the two guards by the porch had taken refuge behind the heavy stone columns , firing without conviction into the dense foliage at the propertys perimeter .	1
manuel stared blearily up at the complex herringbone pattern of the brickwork in the dome built into the roof over his porch , the cupula , his breath gurgling from the holes in his chest as his life ran out onto the rustic stone floor .	1
sadie approached and nosed his face with her own , licking the flecks of blood from his chin in an effort to comfort him , her warm tongue the last thing he would ever register .	1
his eyes met hers for an instant and then grew wide as he noisily exhaled a long groaning rattle before shuddering into stillness .	1
sadie lay beside her master , then stood and circled him .	1
she nudged him again with her nose , and then , as dogs had done since the time theyd joined humans as companions in caves , she sat and pointed her head to the heavens and let forth a baleful howl , filled with all the sadness and pain of the world .	1
her beloved master was gone .	1
she was now alone , as only the surviving can be .	1
chapter 10 what do you mean altamar is missing ?	1
what the fuck does that mean ?	1
missing ?	1
jorge encarlo screamed into his cell phone .	1
does that mean he decided to disappear and bang a fifteen year old for a few days , or does that mean hes mulch in a tomato field ?	1
jefe , im telling you everything i know .	1
i heard from a friend of a friend that he went missing yesterday and his organization is scrambling to find him .	1
doesnt sound like young love to me , the voice on the phone advised .	1
encarlo was a bulldog of a man , heavily muscled with a buzz cut and a closely cropped four day shadow .	1
is there anything else ?	1
god damn it , get some more information .	1
i dont care what you have to do .	1
this could be really big if someones taken the cocksucker out , encarlo snarled .	1
i know .	1
im on it .	1
but you know how this goes .	1
nobodys going to talk if they think they could wind up beheaded for doing so .	1
right .	1
i get it .	1
the problem is that if altamars been taken out , we need to move rapidly or well all be as good as dead , encarlo warned .	1
im doing everything i can .	1
really .	1
give me some more time and ill find out more .	1
this just came in , and its not easy getting anyone on his crew to talk .	1
theyre not chatty types , if you remember .	1
encarlo silently counted to three .	1
look .	1
im not paying you to tell me how hard it is to do your job .	1
im paying for you to do it .	1
so do your fucking job and get me some intelligence , or ill find someone who can .	1
encarlo was fuming and had nobody to take his anger out on .	1
he stared at his little motorola flip phone , the latest model , and snapped it closed in frustration .	1
what the hell was going on with altamar ?	1
if he was really missing in a way that suggested he would never be reappearing except as pieces floating in the river , then encarlo needed to get positioned to take action against the other lieutenants .	1
that was how it worked .	1
if the king was dead , long live whoever was left once the smoke cleared and they hosed the blood off the sidewalks .	1
he didnt make the rules , but he was a survivor , nonetheless .	1
at thirty-one , he was already reputed to be a mover and , even by cartel standards , was utterly ruthless .	1
hed learned early that shock and awe went a long way towards moving you up the food chain , and so he was prone to violent outbursts of slaughter at the slightest provocation .	1
that was his modus operandi and it had served him in good stead .	1
encarlo owned a recycling plant that shipped its product to the united states once it was processed , which had provided excellent cover for shipping other items north as well .	1
his operation was one of many responsible for the growing methamphetamine traffic that was slowly displacing crack cocaine in many areas of the u.s .	1
it was a booming market with a rock-bottom production cost , so the profits from trafficking in the synthetic drug were swelling his accounts .	1
it made the cocaine trade seem like small potatoes , if the growth curve kept up .	1
he picked unconsciously at a scabbed area above his left ear .	1
it was a nervous tick , one of many hed developed from the constant pressure to stay one step ahead of the rest of the wolf pack .	1
encarlo used his own products and consumed a fair amount of both meth and cocaine in a cocktail of stimulants that enabled him to sleep only four hours at a stint .	1
he firmly believed that much of his success was thanks to the long hours he worked , in addition to an innate cunning born of the streets .	1
those traits , combined with a relentless sadistic bent and a sociopathic streak that would have been the envy of any serial killer , made him the perfect mid-level cartel functionary .	1
his men and his competitors were terrified of him , for good reason the chemical supplementation often resulted in erratic mood swings ; he could be set off on a bloody tirade by virtually anything .	1
right now , his antennae were picking up the vibrations of opportunity from the early news of altamars mysterious disappearance .	1
he knew that if he could confirm that the man was actually gone for good , hed be perfectly positioned to capitalize on the situation and take out his rivals before they knew what had hit them .	1
it only got dangerous if all facts were known by all the lieutenants at the same time thats where it became a killing field until only one was left standing .	1
hed gone through that multiple times and there was never any guarantee that you would make it through the next one , no matter how much of a badass you were .	1
the idea of creating a loose coalition like altamar had never entered his head .	1
why would he look to his weaker competitors for cooperation when he could simply eliminate them and claim their networks for his own ?	1
the outreach approach had worked for altamar , but in encarlos opinion it was the flawed plan of a weak man , which would be evidenced by his having been taken out after only two years at the top of his little hub .	1
he needed to know what was going on , and he needed to know now .	1
the anxiety was building and he knew from harsh experience that he had to do something salient .	1
anything .	1
sitting waiting for feedback was too reactive for his tastes .	1
restless , he tapped out a line of cocaine to help him focus , and quickly snorted it using a gold tube he carried for the purpose .	1
he brushed a little on his gums , and shook his head , as if to clear it .	1
the drug now coursing through his system , encarlo resolved to see if he could shake loose some information himself .	1
hed hit the street and see if anything came back from his personal contacts .	1
he had confidence in his men but he couldnt just sit still and wait .	1
glancing at his watch , he noted that it was already nine-thirty in the morning .	1
time to move .	1
he stabbed at the keypad of his office phone and barked orders into it , calling for his car to be brought around .	1
he next dialed his second in command and told him to get three men , packing heavy heat , to meet him at his vehicle in five minutes .	1
encarlo opened his file cabinet , retrieved a glock 26 9mm pistol and slipped it into his windbreaker pocket .	1
it was a small gun but packed a decent wallop , and he hated having to wear a shoulder holster like some undercover cop .	1
hed tried an ankle holster , but it had bothered him ; it was easier to carry the thing in his pocket .	1
encarlo made his way downstairs to the ground level and strode through the office doors , past the heavy industrial equipment in the yard , toward his truck a silver fully loaded lincoln navigator with custom rims and steel armored plates welded into each of the four doors .	1
three men joined him , all toting a variety of submachine guns .	1
he didnt like to screw around when he went out on the town , and believed in being prepared for an assault at all times .	1
it wasnt so much paranoia as occupational hazard , and it had kept him alive so far .	1
his driver nodded at him as he climbed into the passenger seat , the three enforcers climbing in behind him .	1
one of the reasons he liked the big suv was because it had enough room for three grown men in the back .	1
the truck moved toward the front gates , which opened via a configuration of hydraulic pistons activated by the security guard in a booth by the street , and then exploded in a blossom of orange fire .	1
the concussion from the plastique affixed to the gas tank shattered the windows in the nearby buildings as pieces of the truck spiraled through the mushroom cloud of black smoke above it , before inevitably dropping like icarus back to earth .	1
nothing survived that sort of a blast , and the men that came running did so with slim hope of salvaging anything .	1
el rey took several snapshots with his little camera from across the thoroughfare .	1
he put the ford lobo into gear and pulled away down the road to his final destination for the day the third target , who at this point was already as good as neutralized .	1
~ ~ ~ the lushly green acreage around the luis barragan-inspired mansion in the hills outside culiacan was still in the late morning doldrums , the absence of breeze a seasonal effect that made being outdoors in the swelter unpleasant even for the most seasoned natives .	1
armed sentries prowled the immaculately manicured grounds around the house , jittery from adrenaline and sweating from the heat .	1
since early morning theyd been on guard , in a state of high alert .	1
ricardo pilar sat with his inner circle at a square mesquite table in his dining room .	1
the five men who were his closest counselors had serious demeanors , and the air was thick with cigarette smoke and anxiety .	1
hed gotten several frantic phone calls alerting him about the explosion at encarlos plant , and he was troubled by the implications .	1
pilar sensed that a move was being made , but he wasnt sure who was behind it , and hed dispatched a group of armed men to see what information they could get from the network of lower-level cartel soldiers that acted as the informal communication channel on the street .	1
the preliminary reports that had come back werent good .	1
two of his four rivals had departed the earth that morning under violent circumstances .	1
there could only be one explanation , and it warranted swift and decisive action .	1
pilars nemesis , valiente , was making a play for the leadership position that altamar had held , now that the cartel underboss had been officially missing for a significant enough time .	1
that could only mean war to pilar , a seasoned veteran of countless purges and fights .	1
pilar was educated , having attended the university in monterey , and held a degree in business administration that had served him well when creating and managing his network .	1
hed studied and taken to heart the lessons of business school , and fancied himself to be superior to the ignorant thugs whod ascended to equal footing through sheer brutality and the barrel of a gun .	1
while he understood the place for bloodshed , he liked to think of himself as above knee-jerk reactions involving indiscriminate slaughter .	1
but he was no fool , and he sensed that it was time to put down the diploma and strap on the pistols .	1
his captain , eduardo , was arguing passionately , and his lieutenants were nodding approval .	1
this is our chance .	1
weve been patient , but its foolishness to sit here waiting for the war to come to us .	1
if valiente is on the offensive , our best chance to avoid a bloodbath is to make a pre-emptive strike .	1
cut the head off the snake , and the body stops moving .	1
pilar considered the counsel , and then nodded .	1
i agree with eduardo .	1
the explosion that killed encarlo , when combined with news of remarosas execution , is ominous .	1
i have a bad feeling , and i think its safe to conclude that valiente is making a major offensive , which would mean we are next .	1
but its not like we can just waltz in and start shooting to solve the problem .	1
valiente is far too smart to be taken that way .	1
pilar pushed back from the table , stood , and began pacing compulsively while he spoke .	1
while i sympathize with everyones passion , id argue that its misplaced .	1
yes , we need to act , but we also need a coherent plan .	1
right now , all we have is bluster and talk .	1
lets finish with the discussion about whether removing valiente is a good idea .	1
it is .	1
now i want to hear some ideas about how we do so , pilar said , gesturing with his bottle of pelgrino to emphasize his point .	1
his men looked at him , none daring to advance an idea that he would shoot down .	1
heres what we are going to do .	1
i want you to talk among yourselves and think through how best to eliminate valiente by the end of the day .	1
then we can put the proposals on the table , and come up with something that makes sense .	1
but dont waste your time arguing for something thats decided .	1
i need ideas , not passion .	1
and my instinct says that were running out of time , so its time to get busy .	1
pilar glanced at his watch and sighed .	1
i have some commitments i need to attend to .	1
but make no mistake , valiente must die before the sun goes down , and i am relying on you to come up with how we achieve that .	1
pilar fixed each man in turn with an intense stare that bristled with quiet menace .	1
he may have had a veneer of civility from his education , but he was as dangerous as a cornered pit viper , and his men were quick to remember how hed made it to the top of his group .	1
ill be back shortly .	1
make good use of your time .	1
pilar strode from the room , shaking his head .	1
this was a classic turf battle , and he needed to get on top of it before valientes goons showed up with machine guns .	1
he wasnt afraid of that his compound was well equipped with all the latest alarms , electronic sensors and advance warning devices , and he had enough firepower to stop a battalion .	1
he felt safe at his home , and he was confident that if an attempt against him was going to be made , it wouldnt happen there .	1
the dense foliage that extended for miles created a natural barrier , and there was only one road in .	1
so for the moment , at least , he was safe .	1
pilar had thought through valientes likely next step , and he wasnt overly concerned about a frontal assault .	1
but he was vulnerable in ways besides the obvious .	1
if this power struggle lasted very long , business would be negatively impacted , and that would cause disruption among the lieutenants , which could be as dangerous as a shooting war .	1
it was bad enough that pilars rivals were homicidal psychopaths without him having to worry about younger , more junior aspirants to the throne cutting his heart out while he slept .	1
he moved to the pocket doors that separated the great room from the rear deck and took in the beauty of his grounds .	1
it was times of extreme adversity that defined leaders , and even though he fancied himself a civilized man , he understood that it was necessary to be swift an unequivocal in his response to this threat .	1
pilar had no problem killing it went with the territory .	1
but hed always tried to keep the violence at arms length , which while not always successful , enabled him to maintain his presumption of superiority .	1
something in the tree line caught the sun , and pilar squinted to make it out .	1
the hair on his arms bristled as he detected movement and a flash , and the neurons in his brain were ordering his body to drop to the floor as the high-velocity partially jacketed round blew his cheekbone apart , taking the better part of his cerebrum with it .	1
by the time the guards had a chance to respond to the single shot from the perimeter , the shooter had long since departed , the sound of the dirt bike hed pushed silently for a half mile a noisy memory in the woods .	1
~ ~ ~ mexico citys sky was laden with hulking , dark clouds when el rey pulled over the hills and into the infamously dangerous metropolitan traffic .	1
the toyota had run like a champ , was a pleasure to drive , softening the blows of the rutted patches between culiacan and df , or distrito federal , as the locals referred to mexico city .	1
hed gotten the contact information of a man valiente , his new patron and sponsor , had known since childhood .	1
valiente had made a phone call and proposed a relationship that his friend couldnt possibly refuse .	1
the man owned a pawn shop but hed fallen into leveraging his contacts in the underworld and being a facilitator for extermination work the human kind .	1
it was a difficult role for him because he was basically a good and decent man , but the money was simply too attractive to turn down for a no-risk proposition .	1
he had three contractors who handled domestic disputes and business disagreements , and he took twenty percent of the contract price to handle the money and vet the clients .	1
el rey needed someone trustworthy to launder his money and deal with the payments .	1
if he was going to do this professionally , he needed a front office , so to speak and professional representation .	1
he could handle sourcing the jobs but he couldnt haul around several million dollars in hundreds and be effective .	1
he needed a banker and an accountant .	1
valientes contact seemed ideally suited for the role .	1
and valiente had warned his friend what he was dealing with , lest he get the bright idea to take el reys money and run for the hills .	1
in the cartels , if you vouched for someone and made an introduction , and then that someone screwed the person youd introduced , you could expect to be held accountable for your recommendations actions .	1
valiente had seen more than enough of el reys handiwork in a short period to know he didnt want that coming after him .	1
the narcotraficante chief had become el reys biggest admirer and had promised to spread the word of his prowess in return for a commitment to never accept a contract on him .	1
that seemed reasonable to el rey , and valiente was an up-and-comer in the most powerful cartel on the planet , so as sponsors go , he could do worse .	1
his plan was to limit his activity to a few hits a year , but to steadily increase the fee he charged as well as the level of difficulty of the sanctions he accepted until he became the highest paid killer in the world .	1
mexico was the right place for that , given the amount of money flowing through the cartels , although hed heard good things about russia , too .	1
problem there was that he didnt speak the language .	1
hed studied english in school and , of course , there was his spanish .	1
but that was it .	1
so he wouldnt be doing any work in st. petersburg or vladivostok .	1
he merged toward the right lane and took an off ramp from the clogged freeway into an even more congested area of the city .	1
after circling around for half an hour , he eventually located the pawn shop and managed to find a parking spot .	1
he threw his black duffel bag over his shoulder and made his way two blocks to the store .	1
the neighborhood was sketchy even by mexico city standards , which was saying a lot , but then again , money lenders of last resort didnt tend to be located in the ritziest areas .	1
at the glass door to the shop , he noted bars everywhere , providing security against night incursions , as well as a roll-up metal awning that would completely seal off the storefront .	1
with all the bars it seemed like overkill , but el rey liked that it hinted at a man who took precautions , and who over-engineered them .	1
that was a careful man , which is what he needed .	1
the establishment itself was modest by any measure , which suggested a lack of braggadocio or hubris .	1
again , strongly positive from el reys position .	1
he pushed open the entry door and walked into a small , somewhat shabby showroom with a few inexpensive glass cases showcasing the tarnished treasures of the impoverished and downtrodden .	1
silver infant cups , cheap watches , scarred gold chains , obsolete cameras .	1
el rey was liking this guys style more and more .	1
this was the last place in the world he would expect to find a man who handled the affairs of high-end contract killers .	1
nothing about the shop spoke of money or success or high-rolling , which were usually hand in hand with cartel-related businesses .	1
this just said boring .	1
el rey liked boring .	1
he approached the barred window , which was fabricated out of inch-thick bullet-proof glass , and pushed the button next to it , listening as the buzzer echoed in the rear , behind the heavy steel door to his right .	1
he studied the door : it was built like a banks , although it was probably heavier by the looks of the four massive hinge plates welded in place .	1
he rapped a knuckle against the wall next to it at least foot-thick reinforced concrete .	1
a meager enterprise with security like a vault .	1
interesting .	1
footsteps approached , and then a small man with a beret and a graying goatee appeared at the window .	1
yes ?	1
he asked by way of greeting .	1
im here for an eleven oclock meeting , el rey said .	1
ah .	1
of course .	1
the steel door buzzed and el rey rushed to grab the handle before it stopped .	1
he swung it open and noted that hed been correct .	1
the steel slab was very heavy indeed , and the locking mechanism was industrial grade .	1
nice door .	1
mmmm .	1
two one-inch steel plates with a titanium core .	1
custom made in austria .	1
cost a bit , but worth it , the little man said .	1
he extended his hand .	1
jaime tortora , at your service .	1
please .	1
come back to my offices .	1
would you like anything to drink ?	1
water ?	1
coffee ?	1
beer ?	1
el rey shook his hand .	1
no , thank you .	1
i dont drink coffee or alcohol .	1
ill follow you .	1
tortora walked down the dimly lit hallway and opened the door of his office .	1
the two men entered and tortora gestured to one of the chairs in front of his desk .	1
he took his seat behind it and leaned forward , both hands on the surface , visible at all times .	1
el rey noticed this reassuring stance , and nodded almost imperceptibly as he sat , placing the duffle on the chair next to him .	1
a mutual friend of some distinction called and indicated there was an opportunity for us to help each other , tortora began , then hesitated .	1
you may speak freely .	1
i have eavesdropping detection equipment in place , and if you were wired , id know .	1
i also sweep the office once a week .	1
vocational paranoia , you could say .	1
el rey fixed him with a tranquil gaze .	1
i am looking for someone who can help me ; act as a back office and clearing system for my payments and due diligence on clients , el rey said .	1
ah , yes .	1
well , thats what i do .	1
i take twenty percent if i source the clients , or ten percent if you do .	1
i can deal with cash , although thats an additional ten percent right off the top for the bank to handle .	1
i prefer wire transfers or bearer instruments , and have an extensive infrastructure to accommodate those .	1
austria and the caymans , with a second set of accounts in panama and lichtenstein .	1
all owned by dummy front companies out of hong kong or latvia .	1
tortora reached over and took a sip of water from a glass near his computer monitor .	1
i can assist in setting up a structure for you , if that is necessary .	1
my only advice if you intend to do so yourself is to hire a professional .	1
the money trail is often the weak link .	1
id be interested in having you set up a mechanism .	1
i want money to wind up in uruguay or belize .	1
ive read about setting up companies there , international business companies , where the ownership can be held via bearer shares , which are untraceable , el rey observed .	1
yes , but there are some problems with that .	1
id advise a more involved structure , where we first create a trust whose beneficiary is a swiss corporation , and then have the trusts attorney set up the ibc and the bank account .	1
do you need papers ?	1
passports ?	1
identity documents of any kind ?	1
tortora asked .	1
now that you mention it , yes .	1
ill need a spanish passport , a mexican birth certificate and passport , and a third passport , maybe from el salvador or peru .	1
id like them all in different names and , if possible , legitimately issued not forgeries .	1
that can be done .	1
but it will be expensive .	1
probably a couple of hundred thousand dollars .	1
it would be way cheaper to have high quality forgeries created , tortora advised , glancing at the young man .	1
but fakes are not as bullet-proof , no pun intended .	1
the money isnt a concern .	1
how long will it take ?	1
for legitimate documents ?	1
a month or two .	1
i can get the mexican paperwork faster , so if you have pressing travel plans , figure two weeks for that .	1
the rest are more complicated , tortora explained .	1
all right .	1
get the mexican one as soon as possible .	1
now lets talk about how this will work .	1
i have a large sum of cash i need washed so it can be transferred into a bank account once you have the structure set up .	1
why the ten percent for cash ?	1
thats what i have to pay to circumvent the anti-money laundering laws at the bank .	1
its the going rate .	1
how much cash are we talking , anyway ?	1
tortora asked .	1
two million dollars , mas o menos .	1
and likely two hundred fifty thousand per job , couple of times a year .	1
to start .	1
tortora didnt blink .	1
i can handle that .	1
do you have any questions for me ?	1
how many other contractors do you handle ?	1
three .	1
but smaller scale than what youre doing .	1
fifty grand here and there .	1
id like you to drop them .	1
how much would i need to bring in to replace their income ?	1
el rey asked .	1
depends .	1
will you be sourcing your own clients ?	1
absolutely .	1
all youll be doing is handling the money .	1
ill even collect it most of the time , unless theres a wire transfer , which is doubtful , given my clientele .	1
tortora considered the question carefully .	1
one of the issues is that if youre killed , i have lost my business and will have to start over .	1
tortora said , then quickly punched some numbers into his desktop calculator .	1
im not planning on getting killed .	1
nobody does .	1
but its a risk that needs to be adjusted for .	1
i think that if we went fifteen percent up to the first million of income per year , then ten for anything above , i could cut my other contractors loose .	1
but id need to see at least half a million gross per year of income to make it worth my while .	1
thats a lot of contracts , tortora said .	1
not to brag , but soon that will only be two contracts a year , and then only one .	1
so not that many .	1
the assassin sat back and studied tortoras face .	1
i accept your proposal .	1
fifteen of the first million , ten above that .	1
bank fees to come off the top , pre-split .	1
he lifted the duffel and placed it on the desk .	1
this is two million five hundred thousand dollars .	1
take the paperwork money and the fees to create the structure out of it .	1
what will the structuring run , anyway ?	1
el rey asked .	1
not that much .	1
maybe fifty by the time everythings set up .	1
fifteen for the company formations , and the rest for lubrication and consultants and attorneys .	1
then maybe ten grand a year thereafter for filing fees .	1
okay .	1
so call it two point two million cash after deducting for that .	1
minus ten percent for the banks , leaves us at an even two .	1
ill give you fifty of that for your time , given that you havent done any heavy lifting beyond opening some accounts .	1
cut your other operators loose within six months .	1
by then , ill be back and working , el rey instructed .	1
do you have any questions of me ?	1
guarantees about the safety of your money ?	1
our mutual friend must have explained a little .	1
i know you have an apartment upstairs and a home , with a daughter in university .	1
i know everything about you .	1
i can find you wherever you are , no matter how deep you think youve gone , so , no , im not too worried .	1
then again , youd be stupid to try it , because over the next few years youll make a lot of money as my fee increases .	1
and it will .	1
im already at two hundred grand a hit , and that will move to two-fifty on the next ones .	1
el rey wasnt bragging or threatening .	1
his calm , soft voice was merely stating fact .	1
tortora appraised him anew .	1
i believe you .	1
my friend indicated that youd done the impossible in no time .	1
and hes not an easy man to impress .	1
if hes singing your praises , youll have your hands full with work whenever you want it .	1
they discussed more details , such as names for the passports and logistics of contacting each other , and after an hour , concluded their meeting .	1
el rey liked the little man .	1
he was perfect .	1
avaricious but old enough so he wouldnt be a runner .	1
morally neutral on the issue of the business , and not squeamish .	1
a good combination .	1
the money would all accumulate in accounts only el rey had signature authority over , using his new passports and names , so it would be in no danger once it hit his banks .	1
as to the cash , he wasnt worried about that disappearing .	1
there were some things that just werent worth doing , and he got the sense that the pawn shop proprietor had quickly figured out that fucking him over was one of them .	1
he had a spring in his step as he returned to his toyota , one more problem dealt with .	1
this was shaping up nicely , perfectly following the plan hed had in mind since he was seventeen .	1
he would become the highest paid assassin in the world within a few years , famous for meticulously planned sanctions that defied belief .	1
he would become a sort of miracle worker .	1
el rey would be a name that cartel bosses used to frighten their kids at night , and it would be synonymous with a ghost , a phantom who could do the impossible .	1
in a world where nobody got scared , an environment where violence and death was daily currency , there would be something that even the most hardened veterans would fear .	1
the name of the beast .	1
el rey .	1
chapter 11 the jungle was everywhere .	1
that was el reys impression of costa rica , if anyone were to ask him .	1
it was everything hed always imagined when he heard the term rain forest , right down to the toucans and monkeys .	1
and even though everyone spoke spanish it was as different from mexico as he imagined south america would be .	1
he had arrived in the tiny central american country to learn how to fly .	1
specifically , how to operate prop planes and helicopters , should he ever need to be able to do so .	1
rather than resting on his laurels , hed made a personal commitment to continually learn new skills , expanding his abilities as well as the likelihood of survival .	1
in the end , he hadnt been able to convince the mexican special forces to teach him how to operate a plane , so the first stop after hed gotten his new papers was to find a place off the beaten path where he could master the discipline .	1
and costa rica was well off any radar while it had a decent amount of infrastructure , even by mexican standards it was backwards , as were its neighbors , nicaragua , el salvador and honduras .	1
hed considered each of those in turn , but decided on costa rica after researching the alternatives the others were too unstable , with a considerable cartel presence he would rather avoid unless working .	1
the flight school in the capital city of san jose had been more than willing to teach him everything he wanted to know for certification of fixed wing , and he had clocked almost all the required hours he needed .	1
helicopters were a different story , but hed been able to find a pilot who was willing to unofficially give him lessons and explain everything about the mechanics of the crafts .	1
el rey had now been in costa rica for three months and was about ready to get the hell out and back to what he considered civilization .	1
for his money , san jose couldnt hold a candle to guadalajara or monterrey or mexico city , but it has served its purpose .	1
one thing he was sure of was that he wouldnt likely be back unless he lost a bet .	1
he pulled up to the hangar at the edge of the runway and got out of his rental car , and after greeting his flight trainer , they moved to the small cessna 172 prop plane to undertake their pre-flight checklist .	1
el rey was now certified , but he wanted to clock as many hours as possible while he was in central america so he was completely confident in his abilities .	1
just as they were getting into the cockpit , his cell phone rang , and he excused himself for a moment and took a call .	1
it was tortora .	1
our friend called me .	1
he has an urgent matter for you .	1
thinks it could be a real opportunity .	1
how soon can you be in sinaloa ?	1
tortora asked .	1
el rey considered the question , eyeing the surrounding airport as he did so .	1
tomorrow , at the latest .	1
i have to look at flight schedules .	1
worst case i can charter a plane .	1
ill check in later to let you know what my timing looks like .	1
did he indicate how urgent ?	1
he didnt go into detail .	1
said hed prefer to discuss it with you in person .	1
shall i tell him youre en route ?	1
tortora asked .	1
please .	1
but dont tell him from where .	1
thats our little secret .	1
of course not .	1
call me when you know more , tortora said , and then the line went dead .	1
el rey returned to the little plane .	1
sorry , roger , got to cut out .	1
tell me .	1
just for the sake of conversation how much would it cost to hire a plane to get me to mexico city if i needed to leave in the next few hours ?	1
my mother isnt well , el rey explained .	1
im sorry to hear that .	1
whats the distance ?	1
fifteen hundred miles ?	1
a little less .	1
more like twelve hundred .	1
boy .	1
i dont know .	1
you want me to make some calls and find out ?	1
not too many prop planes could make that without setting down at least once .	1
you care if its a jet or prop ?	1
not really .	1
but i need to get going by one oclock on the outside .	1
el rey checked his watch .	1
it was nine in the morning .	1
i know a guy who has that king air over there .	1
he might be into it .	1
but it would probably be ten to fifteen grand make the call .	1
an hour later , and theyd gotten nowhere , so el rey went to the passenger terminal and checked with taca .	1
they had a five oclock flight that would get him into mexico city a couple of hours later , and then he could get a plane to culiacan in the morning .	1
he booked it , paying in cash , and returned to his leased condo to pack .	1
he didnt have much a rucksack with his clothes , thirty thousand dollars in hundreds , and a credit card in the name of one of his companies , with a fifty grand limit .	1
in his line of work , hed found it paid to travel light .	1
he set his bag by the door and then retrieved a rag and a bottle of ammonia-based cleaner , and began the tedious but necessary process of wiping down every area he might have touched .	1
the cleanup took an hour and a half , but he had time to kill , and nobody had ever gotten caught by being overly careful .	1
when he was done , he took a final look around the small condo and nodded , then wiped down the doorknob and deadbolt , twisting it open using the rag , and then repeated the process after closing it .	1
he sauntered down the stairs to the front foyer and eased the steel and glass entry door open , then dropped the rag into a scarred garbage can at the end of the block .	1
the flight to mexico city was tiresome , and once he landed he exhaled a sigh of relief .	1
for all its exotic charms , costa rica hadnt been his cup of tea and he was glad to be back on home turf .	1
he checked the flight schedules to culiacan and found one that departed at eight a.m. , which would put him in culiacan with time to spare for an afternoon meeting with valiente .	1
he booked a room at one of the large hotels connected to the airport terminal that catered to business travelers and settled in for the night , preferring to order room service than venture into town .	1
the next day , he touched down in culiacan and rented a car at the airport .	1
now that he had a variety of ids it made life much easier .	1
he could change around who he was whenever he felt the urge , avoiding any chance of there being a pattern in his coming and going .	1
an admittedly expensive set of precautions , but ultimately worth it to him .	1
when he arrived at valientes office , the cartel honcho greeted him warmly and invited him to sit .	1
after some cursory pleasantries were dispensed with , including el reys congratulations on valiente becoming the new regional chief for the sinaloa cartels northern operations altamars former role they got down to business .	1
valiente slid a grainy black and white photograph of a swarthy man across his desk to el rey , who studied it before looking up at the narcotraficante , his face devoid of expression .	1
thats german coriente .	1
known as el chilango .	1
he used to be one of the ranking members of the jalisco cartel , valiente explained .	1
el rey waited patiently for more .	1
he disappeared a year ago , after a contract was put out on him by the head of our sinaloa cartel , don aranas .	1
the contractor who took the assignment failed to execute him and was never heard from again .	1
we assume that el chilango stopped him somehow , and extracted information from him on who hired him to do the hit .	1
shortly afterwards , el chilango disappeared , and it has taken a full year for us to find him , valiente continued .	1
where is he ?	1
australia .	1
he got a chilean passport and moved to sydney , where nobody knows him .	1
hes hired several mercenaries for security , and bought a wine exportation company to establish residence there .	1
el rey nodded .	1
sounds like he got as far away from mexico as you can get , and hes out of the game .	1
so why go after him ?	1
not to talk myself out of work , but rather so i understand the motivation , el rey said .	1
what do you care why ?	1
we offer a contract , you take it .	1
thats how it works , no ?	1
el rey held valientes gaze and shook his head .	1
if i need to fly halfway around the world to kill someone , i need to know everything .	1
thats one of my conditions .	1
otherwise , respectfully , hire someone else .	1
although it sounds like your last experience with a contractor on this guy didnt work out so well .	1
so again , tell me , why go after a player whos taken himself off the table and is living on the other end of the planet ?	1
el rey asked .	1
valiente initially looked annoyed , but then remembered who he was talking to .	1
el rey was a dangerous man , even by cartel standards .	1
not someone you wanted to make an enemy of .	1
its personal .	1
the hit is personal .	1
unfinished business .	1
personal ?	1
with aranas ?	1
what could el chilango have possibly done to bring that upon himself ?	1
now el rey was genuinely curious .	1
its a long story .	1
apparently , the two men knew each other from many years ago and then when sinaloa went to war with the jalisco cartel , things escalated out of control .	1
that was almost a decade ago , and it went on for years , with heavy casualties on both sides .	1
theyre still enemies to this day , no ?	1
el rey asked .	1
yes .	1
and theyll always be enemies .	1
too much blood spilled to ever build bridges .	1
what happened was that , during the worst of the war , el chilango sent an execution team to take out aranas .	1
but they botched it .	1
you can probably guess how that went down .	1
four killers from veracruz with ak-47s playing cowboys .	1
anyway , turns out aranas wasnt where they were told he would be , so when they shot up the car he was supposed to be traveling in , it wasnt him .	1
it was his twelve year old daughter , imelda , on her way to ballet class .	1
valiente paused to allow that to sink in .	1
she was apparently a rare talent .	1
and beautiful .	1
they tell me she lived for almost a month on machines before the injuries were too much for her .	1
so its personal .	1
every day el chilango breathes is an affront to aranas , and he wants the man erased .	1
which brings us to why you are here , gracing our town with your presence .	1
the assassin nodded .	1
what are the details ?	1
the most important thing to understand is that aranas doesnt just want a hit .	1
he wants el chilango to suffer .	1
a lot .	1
i had mentioned to him how adept youve been in handling our transactions , and he authorized me to reach out to you .	1
so here i am .	1
and now , here are you as well .	1
whats the contract price ?	1
el rey was curious how badly they wanted him dead .	1
two hundred fifty thousand dollars .	1
el rey shook his head , holding valientes gaze .	1
too low for the risk involved .	1
a foreign country , likely many unusual expenses , a police force that cant be bought , foreign mercenariesi dont mean to sound like an ingrate , but that wont cover it , el rey explained .	1
valiente sat back , exasperated .	1
then whats the right number for you to take this on ?	1
i know i can get any of a dozen men who would jump at doing this for fifty .	1
you tried that once .	1
these arent the kinds of situation where you look to save money .	1
if you want the best and you want a guaranteed result , you will pay more than hiring someone who will try , and fail .	1
sounds like if you blow it one more time , hell disappear on you for good .	1
im not sure id want to have to deliver that news to don aranas .	1
el rey studied a point on the wall for a few moments .	1
my number is three hundred thousand .	1
done .	1
plus expenses , which will probably come to another fifty to a hundred .	1
i wont know until i get over there and see the lay of the land .	1
valientes eyes narrowed to slits .	1
fair enough .	1
and ill need specialized gear once im in-country , so youll have to find a local who can get hard-to-find items for me .	1
i wont know what they are until im on the ground , but it could be specialized weapons , or explosives , or gas .	1
dont know .	1
do you have any contacts there ?	1
el rey asked .	1
theres nowhere in the world we dont have contacts .	1
ill find someone .	1
valiente smiled .	1
is there anything else ?	1
i expect you to pay for the travel , too .	1
ill bet first class tickets to sydney arent going to be cheap .	1
el rey rose to his feet .	1
i can leave tomorrow .	1
ill need half the money in advance , as usual , and an atm card set up so i can withdraw up to a hundred thousand dollars on it from anywhere in the world .	1
that way i can pull money out as necessary .	1
el rey paused , thinking .	1
no , better yet , give me fifty in cash , and fifty on an atm .	1
do you have a package on him ?	1
valiente pushed a manila envelope across the table .	1
el rey opened the top , glanced at the contents and nodded .	1
valiente reached below his desk and retrieved a slim briefcase .	1
heres two hundred and fifty , cash .	1
call that two for you , and fifty for expenses .	1
ill have a card for you within a few days and will send it to you by dhl .	1
that way youll have it within a week , on the outside .	1
my guess is youll want to spend some time lining things up before you do this .	1
am i right ?	1
el rey ignored the question .	1
so you would have paid five hundred ?	1
we think very highly of your talents .	1
but it sounds like youll wind up costing four by the time this is done , so you can make it up on the next one .	1
and if you pull this off for aranas , there will be as many next ones as you want .	1
valiente grinned .	1
its only money , right ?	1
you have a point .	1
ill look into hotels and flights .	1
timeframe for the hit ?	1
if you can bring it in within ten days that will do .	1
shouldnt be an issue , if hes only got a couple of bodyguards .	1
do you have dossiers on them ?	1
el rey asked .	1
its in there .	1
ones south african , the other british who saw a tour in afghanistan .	1
not pushovers , thats for sure .	1
they all die the same .	1
too true .	1
you need anything else from my end ?	1
just get in touch with someone who can get me whatever i need in australia .	1
ill get a cell phone once im there and touch base for the contact info .	1
el rey stood , and hefted the briefcase .	1
hate to leave a hundred on the table , but it is what it is .	1
i have a feeling if you make it ugly enough for el chilango , theres a chance of a bonus .	1
aranas isnt that price sensitive .	1
tell me .	1
does he have any other children ?	1
el rey asked .	1
valiente looked at him strangely .	1
i think hes got two sons .	1
im not sure , though .	1
we arent that close , valiente admitted .	1
his only daughter .	1
no , i imagine hes not price sensitive at all .	1
he held up the briefcase and moved towards the door , hesitating before he left .	1
when he turned to face valiente a final time , even the hardened cartel drug lords stomach lurched when el rey offered a diminutive smirk .	1
ill get creative .	1
chapter 12 sydney was unlike any place el rey had ever been .	1
from the time he got off the plane , his qantas first class experience a welcome luxury on the fifteen hour flight from los angeles , he was struck by how clean everything was .	1
it was as if someone had scrubbed every surface right before he got there but the entire town , as far as he could see wandering around the downtown area , was like that .	1
he took a cab from the airport to his hotel a few blocks from sydney harbor and stowed his gear , locking his cash in the hotel room safe and unpacking his hygiene kit .	1
after a few hours of sleep to get adjusted to the seven hour time difference , he set out to explore the town so hed understand the layout .	1
a four minute walk to the ferry terminal at circular quay quickly convinced him that the town was filled with tourists , so one more from mexico wouldnt stick out , which had been one of his fears .	1
he never wanted to be memorable anywhere he went but there would be no such problem here judging by the host of accents and languages he heard as he moved along the waterfront from the quaint shopping area called the rocks toward the opera house .	1
el rey approached the iconic theater , which sat on a point at the waters edge , its aggressive shape unmistakable from almost every photo and postcard hed seen .	1
he kept walking towards the ocean and soon found himself in a verdant , well-groomed park , where he passed young lovers reposing on the grass , stealing moments together after school .	1
the weather was the equivalent of late autumn in australia , the seasons being reversed from the northern hemisphere , but it was still relatively mild and sunnier than hed expected .	1
and so clean .	1
being used to mexico , sydney was a shock to his system in that it was so aseptic .	1
even as he made his way out of the park into an area that was supposedly seedier , it was as nice as some of the best neighborhoods back home .	1
he stopped at a long pier with a sign out front that announced it as finger wharf and looked in at a hotel built over the harbor the w sydney and felt immediately comfortable in the dimly lit , soothing , minimalistic contemporary lobby .	1
it was deserted , save for a young woman working behind the desk and , based on the ambience and the solitary location , he decided right then and there that hed be moving to the w the following day .	1
walking away from the harbor , he explored the area inland from the hotel .	1
it quickly degraded into a run-down industrial district with warehouses alongside shabby lower-income housing .	1
a few of the buildings looked as though they were about to undergo renovation but much of the area was desolate and he found himself the only person on the streets mid-afternoon on a weekday .	1
he made a mental note : this was perfect for what he had in mind .	1
hed begun the outlines of a rough plan on the plane , purely conceptual , but if everything panned out it could work well .	1
after another hour meandering the streets adjacent to the waterfront he made his way back to the hotel , where he hailed a cab and asked the driver to drop him two streets away from the address where el chilango now lived .	1
they drove into an upscale area fifteen minutes from the city center , and the cab stopped in front of a small market a block from the harbor .	1
the neighborhood was eclectic , exhibiting a hodgepodge of architectural styles coexisting in a dissonant manner .	1
everything from elegant multi-story turn-of-the-century victorian mansions to post-modern contemporary could be found .	1
it was certainly a prosperous area , judging by the cars and the trim on the houses .	1
el rey knew that waterfront homes anywhere in the world were always the most expensive he figured that australia would be no different .	1
he bought a bottle of water from the bored shopkeeper and then strolled towards the targets address , relieved to find that the sidewalks were empty .	1
when he reached the t junction that dead-ended into the target street he deliberately avoided el chilangos house , preferring to make a left on the street that ran along the waterfront homes rather than a right .	1
he knew that the former cartel chiefs home was four down on the right from the intersection where he made the turn , and he didnt really need to see much more than he did by glancing down the street as though he was a stray sightseer whod wandered into the area .	1
he knew from the report hed read on the plane that it was a two story , five bedroom waterfront home on a double lot , with security lighting at night activated by motion sensors on the sides of the house , as well as the street .	1
comfortable with the feel of the neighborhood , he walked six blocks until he came to a major artery , and had a coffee shop call him a taxi while he enjoyed a cup of pungent green tea .	1
once back at his hotel , he did a quick calculation of the time back home before going downstairs to ask the concierge where he could get a cell phone .	1
the pert young woman directed him four blocks away , and soon he was paying for the latest model nokia with a three month prepaid service plan .	1
as soon as it was activated , he fished a matchbook out of his pocket and dialed the country code and phone number hed jotted down .	1
valientes voice answered .	1
im here .	1
do you have anything for me on a local contact ?	1
el rey asked .	1
valiente gave him a sydney cell number .	1
youll want to ask for victor , valiente said , then terminated the call , there being nothing more to discuss .	1
he did as instructed , and a gravelly , australian voice answered .	1
el rey told the man he was from out of town , and used valientes name by way of entre .	1
they arranged to meet an hour later at a caf immediately in front of the ferry terminal .	1
victor would be wearing an orange t-shirt with a blue windbreaker and tan cargo pants .	1
el rey watched from his vantage point across the busy common as a man dressed as described entered the caf and sat down by the window .	1
after five minutes of scanning the quay to ensure there was no surveillance , el rey strolled in and took a seat opposite him .	1
victor was in his mid forties and rail thin , with a heavily lined , sun-damaged face boasting the perennial flush of the habitual hard drinker , spectacularly crooked teeth , and thatches of salt-and-pepper hair pointing in all directions .	1
he looked like nothing so much as an absentminded professor with a boozing problem .	1
gday , mate .	1
names victor .	1
i was told to give yah whatever yah needed , and mums the word , victor started .	1
el rey couldnt really make out what the man was saying , so instead began speaking in his quiet , calm voice .	1
his english was passable from years of study , but still heavily accented with spanish inflection .	1
i will need a boat with a captain tomorrow to take me around the harbor so i can look over some places .	1
i have also made a list of items i will require .	1
and i think ive found an area with some industrial space you can rent inexpensively .	1
if not , i need a small warehouse in a quiet neighborhood where it will have no neighbors , good for privacy , yes ?	1
el rey handed him the neatly hand-written note with his requirements .	1
victor studied it , and nodded .	1
no worries , mate .	1
good as done but itll run yah dear .	1
my guess is twenty grand american at least , plus the boat tour .	1
how many rounds you need for the rifle and the pistol ?	1
victor asked .	1
a hundred for the rifle and its magazines , and fifty for the pistol and its spares .	1
will the night vision equipment be a problem ?	1
mate , none of its a problem .	1
just a matter of money .	1
give me two days and ill have the whole lot sorted , victor assured him .	1
now in the meantime , what about yerself ?	1
need any company ?	1
interested in the ladies ?	1
seeing the vacant expression on the assassins face and intuiting a lack of interest , he tried again .	1
or maybe the boys ?	1
a little cage aux follees , if yah catch my meaning ?	1
whatever yer flavor , victors the man just the items on the list , some warehouse space with no neighbors and a boat with a captain .	1
nothing fancy .	1
something that will blend in .	1
id like to use it tomorrow for around four hours .	1
and make sure its got some fishing equipment onboard .	1
ill call you in the morning .	1
will that work for you ?	1
el rey asked , ignoring victors offer .	1
victor assured him that it would , and they quickly parted ways , victor to procure the necessary hardware and el rey to have an early dinner and get some sleep .	1
the following day , victor had made arrangements for a cabin cruiser to pick el rey up at the pier marina that hosted the w hotel and the adjacent condominiums and restaurants .	1
he checked out of his current hotel and walked over to the w , taking a waterfront room for a week on the third floor .	1
once hed unpacked , he grabbed a quick bite downstairs before heading out to meet the boat , a heavy set of binoculars around his neck .	1
it was a thirty-eight-foot riviera sports fisherman with twin diesel engines , and soon they were cutting through the chop at a fair clip .	1
el rey gave the captain gps coordinates for the portion of the harbor he wanted to anchor in and fish .	1
the man looked at him as though he was crazy .	1
wont catch much there but muck suckers , mate , he advised .	1
thats okay .	1
i just like being on the water , enjoying the scenery and looking at all the beautiful houses , el rey explained .	1
they motored to the designated spot and dropped anchor .	1
the captain dutifully got out two light-tackle salt water fishing rods and a bag of frozen bait .	1
el rey played along and allowed the man to drop a line into the water for him , then went inside the salon , where the heavily tinted windows blocked anyone from seeing in .	1
he raised his binoculars and scanned the house , noting the neighbors homes , searching for anything that could afford him an advantage .	1
he paid special attention to the shore area and the distances between the homes , which wasnt much .	1
fortunately , el chilango had built tall walls on either side for security and privacy , so he wouldnt have to deal with neighbor issues once inside .	1
as they sat there , bobbing in the wake of the boats cruising past them , he noted that there were three security men nosing around , not just the one the report would have led him to believe .	1
so either the house had received some sort of warning , or the surveillance had been sloppy .	1
instead of a day man and a night one , there were six total : three and three .	1
they spent two hours at anchor , the boat rocking gently , with el rey mainly watching the house .	1
by lunchtime , hed seen enough .	1
the target had been visible several times in his living room and bedroom , and it would have been a cinch to take him out with a single shot .	1
unfortunately , that wasnt what he was being paid to do .	1
reconciling himself to the unpleasant reality that hed have to do this the hard way , he announced to the captain that it was time to leave .	1
just then one of the two rods screamed as line tore off the reel the skipper ran to tighten the drag .	1
he set the hook and then offered the pole to el rey , who shook his head he had no interest in trying to fight the fish .	1
after a few moments the line went limp ; when the captain reeled it in , the leader had been bitten through .	1
probably a shark , he said .	1
are there a lot of them around here ?	1
el rey asked , curious .	1
in the harbor , yah get some sand sharks and a few larger ones .	1
out in the ocean , theres great whites , ya know .	1
frightful big buggers .	1
one of em gets ya , yer days pretty much ruined .	1
dont want to mess with one of those , ill tell yah , he warned .	1
no .	1
id imagine not .	1
that evening , el rey had a phone discussion with victor , and they arranged a meeting for the next day to look over the industrial space hed gotten and inventory the hardware .	1
in the morning , a blue ford sedan pulled to the curb by the original hotel el rey had stayed at .	1
victor grinned from behind the wheel , inviting him to get in .	1
soon they were motoring to the deserted area near the w , and after a few turns , they arrived at a bleak strip of old industrial warehouses .	1
victor got out and opened one of the heavy steel doors and they stepped into a dilapidated twenty-by-forty brick space that reeked of stale air and urine .	1
el rey tried the lights two fluorescent bulbs flickered above as if struggling to stay lit , and then with a flash , suddenly illuminated .	1
the assassin studied the shabby interior , his arms crossed , and then nodded .	1
this will do .	1
glancing around the dank room a final time , el rey dictated an additional list of items hed need , based on his surveillance of the target and his appraisal of his new workspace .	1
victor scribbled furiously in a small notebook as el rey ticked off the requirements .	1
finished , they eyed the overhead steel beams that supported the roof , before el rey made two more requests .	1
victor nodded , and assured him that within forty-eight hours he would have the space outfitted , and then went to the car and removed a long duffle with the requested hardware and brought it inside the space .	1
el rey inspected each item carefully and nodded in approval .	1
perhaps victor resembled a buffoon , but hed gotten everything right on the first try .	1
that was good .	1
he hoped victor did as well on the second round of stuff .	1
none of it was that specialized , so he was confident the man would be able to get it all .	1
three days later , they returned to the warehouse .	1
it had been completely transformed .	1
el rey was impressed .	1
hed spent parts of the last few days in the targets neighborhood , driving around with victor , studying the layout , and had a watcher confirm the number of guards at night , as well .	1
el chilango rarely left the house , so whatever his wine business was , you could apparently run it from home .	1
that would make things somewhat harder it would be far easier to stage something while a target was in transit , but you played the cards you were dealt , and el rey was confident .	1
tomorrow would be show time , and he would either justify the considerable money hed been spending over the course of his antipodean vacation or die trying .	1
chapter 13 stiff gusts of wind blew through the tall oak trees near the waters edge , occasionally eliciting a moaning lament at the airs harmonic passage through the branches .	1
it was a partially cloudy night with only a sliver of a moon peeking through the overcast .	1
the lights from the surrounding homes on the harbor twinkled and danced as the roiling surface of the water reflected them up , moving in time with the swell from the harbor mouth as it surged against the outcropping shore of point piper , as the upscale neighborhood was called a nub of land thrusting into the water , creating double bay on one side and rose bay on the other .	1
three tough-looking guards prowled the grounds of the targets home , two stationed front and back , with one circulating around .	1
it was a lot of security for a relatively modest home in a safe area .	1
the neighbors had to wonder who the occupant was .	1
the men did their best to appear discreet but they were obviously trained killers with military bearings and the tell-tale bulges of handguns under their windbreaker jackets .	1
this was the easiest duty any of them had ever had .	1
endless hours of nothing guarding a nobody from imagined threats that never materialized .	1
theyd gotten complacent over the nine months theyd been working the gig , which was understandable given the uneventful nature of the job .	1
but if it made the man happy , it was his money to spend as he liked and they werent going to complain .	1
for fifteen thousand american dollars a month apiece , theyd put on a trapeze performance or ride unicycles on a tightrope every evening if thats what their patron wanted .	1
it was quiet at one a.m. on a weeknight , with very few cars winding their way along the new south head road that tracked the coastline .	1
sydneys suburbs were asleep , the citizenry enjoying its well-deserved rest in the privileged enclave .	1
a small black inflatable dinghy moved towards the shore , slicing through the small swells as it made its silent way through the night .	1
a hundred yards off the point , the operator dropped an anchor into the water before cutting the little electric motor .	1
he sat , rising and falling with the waves , getting a sense for the amplitude and acclimating himself .	1
the waterside of the targets home glimmered through the luminescent green of the night vision scope .	1
el rey could easily make out the sentry , sitting on the rear deck , smoking a cigarette and reading a book .	1
very unprofessional , but then again , given that the biggest threat the security team thought they were likely to encounter was an enraged koala on a eucalyptus-fueled rampage , he could appreciate their lackadaisical attitude .	1
it would be the last mistake any of them ever made .	1
but still , it was understandable .	1
the crosshairs of the modified m4 assault rifles night scope bounced up and down from the waves , the weapon made ungainly from the additional weight of the long flash-suppressing silencer affixed to the barrels end .	1
the surface movement would decrease the likely accuracy , but hed spent a few hours in a rural area out of town sighting it in with victor yesterday for exactly the required distance and the margin of error was acceptable down to a variance of two inches .	1
an additional factor would be the brisk breeze , and he automatically made a mental adjustment for it .	1
it was blowing from the harbor mouth toward the point at his back , so shouldnt have a huge effect .	1
hed spent the prior morning loading twenty shells with a special blend of a more powerful charge to compensate for the velocity difference the silencer introduced , which had proved worthwhile when he was sighting it in .	1
the higher-powered payload attenuated any distortion introduced by the device .	1
hed flattened the tips of each slug a little and carved an x into the top before filling the indentations with solder and filing them so there would be no danger of a jam .	1
nothing could ruin a well-planned assault like a faultily loading weapon , and so hed spent hours on the task before taking the gun out and putting it through its paces .	1
he watched as the roaming sentry approached the seated guard , presumably to ask for a cigarette , because the seated man reached into his breast pocket and offered him one from his pack .	1
el rey regarded the two sentries through the scope , taking care to close his eyes while the seated man lit the others smoke .	1
it wouldnt do to ruin his night vision with the matchs flare .	1
as the pair chatted lazily on the rear stone patio of the darkened house , el rey gently squeezed the trigger .	1
the standing man crumpled next to the seated guard , his chest exploding outward and onto his stunned partner ; the fragmented slug having torn through his back , the shards exiting his front along with chunks of his pulmonary system and heart .	1
el rey caressed the trigger again , gently , as a lover might the receptive lips of his mate , and the seated mans throat blew onto the heavy stucco houses rear faade .	1
that left the guard in front , who would be getting a little apprehensive within a few minutes when the roaming man didnt return on his appointed rounds .	1
el rey waited patiently for the inevitable , and was rewarded after seven minutes by the sight of the third sentry rounding the corner of the house .	1
another well-placed shot took him down before he could draw his weapon .	1
the assassin checked his watch and smiled to himself in just ten minutes , the threat from the security force had been neutralized .	1
he watched the grisly tableau for a few moments to ensure nobody was moving , then placed the rifle in the bottom of the boat before shrugging into a scuba harness .	1
he double-checked the waterproof bag for the cell phone and two pistols before propelling himself backwards with a dull splash into the cold water of the bay .	1
it took him three minutes to swim the distance , and when he pulled himself onto the shallow beach in front of the house , he paused to unclasp the tank and remove the scuba rig , dropping it where he stood on the sand , along with his flippers .	1
they , like the boat , would be recovered later that night by victors clean-up men , so he wasnt worried about leaving any traces .	1
he padded in his neoprene dive booties to the grass that separated the patio from the beach and extracted a silenced beretta 92fs pistol from the bag .	1
quickly gliding to where the corpses lay , he put a muffled slug into each mans head , purely out of professional diligence .	1
there was nothing more disruptive to a well-planned operation than a wounded man with a gun exhibiting second-wind heroics .	1
the niggling housekeeping chores concluded , el rey studied the locking mechanism of the rear pocket doors before fishing out a foot-long stainless steel strip that looked much like a ruler , which is what in fact it was , albeit modified with a jagged hook ground out of one end .	1
he slid it carefully through the center section , and with an abrupt pull , opened the lock .	1
back into the bag it went , and he fished out the second pistol an odd-looking gas-powered gun that fired a horse-tranquilizer dart .	1
the house blueprints victor had sourced from the building department were still fresh in his mind as he stealthily ascended the stairs to where he knew the master bedroom was located .	1
the neoprene soles of his booties made his steps silent a fortunate by-product of his unfashionable outfit .	1
as he drew nearer to the partially opened master bedroom door , his ears pricked up , listening for any tell-tale warning signs .	1
satisfied that the house was still , he pushed the door open , only to be rewarded with a creak from the hinges , corroded by the salt air .	1
the figure on the bed stirred at the sound and then lunged for the dresser .	1
el rey fired the dart gun left handed at him the dart missed by a scant few inches and embedded itself into the pillow .	1
the target swung around at him with a silenced pistol and began firing even as el rey made a split-second judgment call and charged him rather than shooting him .	1
he ignored the white hot stab of pain that lanced through his upper leg as he hurled himself through the air at the prone , firing el chilango , and within a heartbeat had dislodged the gun and was grappling with his left hand for the dart as he slammed his beretta butt into the mans head with his right .	1
the struggle was over in a matter of seconds , and the former cartel boss slumped into the mattress as the darts soporific venom , stabbed into the side of his neck , found its way into his bloodstream .	1
el rey lay still on top of the target for a few moments , assessing the throbbing pain from his thigh .	1
he felt blood seeping from the wound but it wasnt spurting , which meant the projectile hadnt hit an artery .	1
still , it was bad , and the pain was significant .	1
after looking around the room , he rose and limped to the master closet and flicked on the light .	1
his eyes scanned the rows of neatly hanging clothes until they alighted on a bathrobe with a sash for cinching the waist .	1
he pulled the fabric strip loose , then pulled drawers open until he found some white cotton undershirts , all folded in neat little parcels .	1
he grabbed one and tied it in place using the sash , studying the makeshift bandage with acerbic satisfaction .	1
it would do until he could get medical attention .	1
he returned to the dark bedroom and reached into the waterproof bag dangling from his dive belt to retrieve the cell phone .	1
peering at the targets inert form on the bed , he pressed a speed dial number .	1
victors voice answered .	1
front door .	1
two minutes .	1
ive been hit , so ill need a medic as soon as possible , el rey whispered .	1
hit ?	1
how bad ?	1
small caliber pistol clipped me in the leg .	1
be here in two minutes , and send the cleanup crew to get the gear and the boat .	1
ill have the lads push the bodies into the bay as well , if yah dont mind , victor suggested .	1
no worries , el rey answered , in the ubiquitous manner hed heard used countless times by the locals since his arrival .	1
gimping over to the bed , he lifted el chilango by both arms and dragged him roughly into the hall and then down the stairs .	1
the man would be out cold for two hours , he knew , and when he awoke his head would feel like someone had hammered it with a board , which wasnt far from the truth , given the gashes the pistol had left , the blood already coagulating and crusting where it had streamed down his face .	1
on the ground floor , he slid the inert body to the front entrance foyer and watched through the side window for the vehicle .	1
twenty seconds later , he saw an outline pull up .	1
he swung the door open , to be greeted by the sight of victor trotting from the black delivery van theyd arranged for the evenings festivities .	1
he took a hard look at el rey , standing in the doorway with blood oozing through the t-shirt affixed to his leg , and then wordlessly went to el chilango and began dragging him to the back of the van .	1
el rey limped over , helped get the target into the back , and climbed in after him .	1
get me a doctor .	1
i think the bullet passed clean through , but i need to get cauterized and stitched up , he instructed .	1
ive got a call in .	1
should hear back any minute .	1
lets do that before we hit the warehouse , shall we ?	1
i can secure our friend here so if he wakes up in the interim he cant get up to any mischief , victor said .	1
good .	1
lets go .	1
victor closed the back doors and ran around to the drivers seat .	1
in the blink of an eye they were headed down the carefully manicured street , bound for the main road .	1
victor was just turning onto the larger artery when his cell rang .	1
yeah .	1
i need it now .	1
ten minutes out , maybe fifteen .	1
your shop ?	1
no worries , victor said , and hung up .	1
he leaned towards the rear compartment .	1
well swing by his office .	1
hes pretty good for this kinda thing , victor assured el rey .	1
they drove through sydney until they reached a rough-looking section , the buildings shabby and tattooed with graffiti .	1
victor pulled to the curb in front of a small storefront featuring photos of yellow labrador puppies bounding about in a grassy meadow .	1
a short , bald , overweight man stood in the doorway , fumbling for keys to open it .	1
el rey looked up when victor eased the rear van doors open and gingerly slid himself out and onto the sidewalk , waving off the unspoken offer of assistance .	1
he looked at the little man and then at the shop window , then glared at victor .	1
a veterinarian ?	1
he whispered .	1
blokes top shelf .	1
have you running marathons in no time .	1
does all my sensitive jobs .	1
no worries , mate .	1
nigel , come over and lets get our man here inside , victor called out .	1
i can make it .	1
lets just get this over with , el rey hissed through clenched teeth .	1
he limped to the door , which nigel had finally opened after locating the correct key .	1
names nigel .	1
doctor nigel to you , he said , offering his hand .	1
im shot in the leg .	1
lets clean it and sew it up , el rey said , moving inside .	1
they walked to the back of the shop , where there was a small exam room with a stainless steel table in the center .	1
nigel flicked on the lights while victor returned to the van to shackle their captive .	1
best get you up on the table , then .	1
lets see what weve got here , nigel said , donning a disposable surgical apron and mask .	1
he turned to where el rey now lay and peered at the wound .	1
ill have to cut away your party dress , if you can deal with the loss .	1
do what you have to do .	1
nigel expertly untied the dressing and snipped away the neoprene , cutting the entire wetsuit leg off just below the groin and pulling it off .	1
blood seeped slowly from the holes on both sides of el reys thigh .	1
nigel moved to the medicine cabinet , filled a syringe with novocain and injected it carefully on the edges of the wound , finishing by squirting some directly in .	1
the pain receded , replaced by sweet numbness .	1
nigel swabbed the bullet hole and then used a pair of forceps to examine it .	1
you got lucky .	1
missed the bone , and nothing major hit other than muscle .	1
itll smart for a bit , but i can stitch you up and youll be a new man in no time , he assured el rey .	1
the slug passed clean through so ill just dump some antiseptic in , give you some antibiotics , some orange juice , and do a bit of sewing .	1
job done , mate .	1
give me two more syringes of the anesthetic , too .	1
i need to do some more work tonight , and its helping .	1
too right , then .	1
couple of sticks of feel good to go .	1
can do .	1
now lets close you , shall we ?	1
fifteen minutes later , the wound had been tended .	1
nigel sprayed both stitched areas with a metallic silver spray and stood back to admire his handiwork .	1
el rey sat up and began drinking a bottle of orange juice nigel had brought him .	1
the vet handed him two bottles of pills and two full syringes .	1
that theres iron , for rebuilding your red blood cells , and thats doxycycline .	1
take one every eight hours for ten days .	1
the numbing juice should be good for an hour or two each go .	1
id remember to use alcohol to sterilize the area before you inject , and lose the syringe after using it once .	1
dont want to introduce any more germs than you need to , right ?	1
now , if youll take down your suit , i need to give you a shot in the bum so you dont die of sepsis .	1
el rey pulled down the zipper at the front of his neck and obliged .	1
the injection in his ass hurt almost as much as the gunshot had .	1
the pain subsided after thirty seconds , and he realized it was hot in the suit , so he left it unzipped when he pulled it back up .	1
are we done ?	1
victor asked , coming back in after eavesdropping on the discussion .	1
yep .	1
he should rest for a few days .	1
call me if theres any complications , like high fever or obvious signs of infection .	1
nigel gave a wan smile .	1
he fixed el rey with a good-natured gaze , his eyes twinkling with merriment .	1
youll have a little pucker there , once you heal , to show the ladies .	1
cut out the stitches in seven days .	1
could do it in four , but sevens better if youre going to be walking around on it , which i imagine you will .	1
thanks , doc .	1
youre a dream , victor said , shaking nigels hand .	1
el rey silently walked out of the room towards the front of the store , anxious to deliver his captive to the warehouse and fulfill his contract .	1
he was ready to get to work .	1
chapter 14 outside the warehouse , the streets were empty , save for a mottled , scrawny cat nosing its way down the sidewalk in search of edible bounty .	1
it paused at a rubbish container thirty yards from the sliding metal door , sniffing for anything to feed on .	1
it looked up , startled by the van swinging round the corner , and quickly darted off in search of safer pickings .	1
victor got out of the van and slid the door open before driving inside .	1
he killed the engine , then returned to the door to close it .	1
el rey stopped him .	1
lets get him out of the back , and ill take it from here .	1
ill call you when im done .	1
victor eyed him .	1
its your party .	1
you can play whatever music yah like , he said , strolling to the rear of the van and opening the doors .	1
el chilango lay , still unconscious , with duct tape over his mouth , his legs bound with it and his wrists cuffed together in front of him .	1
victor rooted around in his pocket and wordlessly handed el rey the key to the cuffs .	1
they dragged the ex-cartel chief out and dumped him unceremoniously onto the floor .	1
victor took a quick scan of the workspace .	1
everything yah asked for is here .	1
theres some clothes , the sony , and all the rest .	1
he grinned , looking cadaverous under the harsh fluorescent lighting .	1
just ring me , and ill be by in ten .	1
i hafta go attend to making sure the clean-up boys did their job and didnt miss anything .	1
good luck , mate , he said , then climbed into the drivers seat and started the van .	1
it swung back out onto the street , and el rey closed the large door behind it , latching it in place so they wouldnt be disturbed .	1
he took a good look at his prisoner and hobbled to the table in the corner , unfolding the clothes hed left there before changing into them .	1
once he was done , he studied the items scattered around the table and moved to a wickedly sharp combat knife and a pair of surgical scissors .	1
hed set the camera up later .	1
he wanted to get everything right for his performance art debut , and he had a very specific idea about how his project would begin .	1
el chilango came to with a start and instantly began shivering as he registered the cold cement floor against his naked body .	1
he shook his head in an effort to clear it , tried to move his arms and legs .	1
it was no good .	1
hed been bound .	1
out of the periphery of his vision , he made out movement , and he craned his neck to see what fresh hell hed fallen into .	1
a young latino man stepped into view .	1
i see the smelling salts worked .	1
how are you feeling ?	1
el rey asked in spanish .	1
what are you doing ?	1
what do you want ?	1
money ?	1
i have a lot of it , el chilango said .	1
im glad to hear that .	1
hopefully you have a current will , too .	1
it would be a shame if it all went to waste , no ?	1
el chilango grimaced .	1
i can make you rich .	1
anything you want , i can give you .	1
thats an attractive offer .	1
really .	1
its not every day someone offers to make all my dreams come true , el rey mused , walking over to a tripod where a small video camera was positioned .	1
he looked through the screen and adjusted the height a little and then , satisfied , pulled a balaclava from his pocket and pulled the knit mask over his head .	1
he depressed the record button and verified that it was operating correctly before moving back to el chilango .	1
what the fuck are you doing ?	1
did you hear me ?	1
i can give you any amount of money you want .	1
any .	1
a million dollars .	1
five million .	1
ten .	1
anything .	1
just say the number and i can make it so el chilango was panicking after seeing the mask he realized what was happening .	1
please .	1
you dont have to do this .	1
i can make you rich for life his protestations were cut off by the clanking of chain feeding through an overhead electric winch mounted to one of the crossbeams .	1
the motor whined , and he felt pressure on his ankles as it slowly started lifting him off the floor .	1
oh god , no .	1
please .	1
name a number .	1
anything once he was suspended upside down , he began shrieking and howling in stark fear , squirming and struggling in a futile effort to get free .	1
the motor stopped when his head was three feet off the floor .	1
he spun gently in a circle from his efforts , slowly returning to the central position , his face looking in fear at the camera .	1
el rey checked the image through the viewfinder one last time and nodded , satisfied with the composition .	1
its so hard to create an interesting film .	1
sustaining the drama , capturing the pathos , making the audience feel like theyre involved , el rey lamented .	1
let me down .	1
you dont have to do this .	1
please , the cartel boss whimpered , saliva flecking from his mouth with every word .	1
el rey moved to the table and donned a clear plastic raincoat , taking care to snap up the front of it .	1
when he turned to face el chilango , he looked at his watch and ignited the tip of the welding torch he held in one hand with the long-handed fireplace lighter he held in the other .	1
el chilangos eyes grew wide .	1
so you can give me any amount of money i want ?	1
el rey asked .	1
yes .	1
anything .	1
youll be rich .	1
i can make you rich .	1
millions , he pleaded , beginning to cry as he saw the blue flame and understood the implications of the camera and his complete nudity .	1
tell me .	1
what does it cost to bring a twelve-year-old ballerina back to life ?	1
how much is a little girls life worth ?	1
whats the going rate ?	1
el chilango struggled to process the question , to make sense of what was being asked , and then awareness dawned on him .	1
nooooooooo urine streamed down his bare chest as he lost control of his bodily functions out of raw terror .	1
el rey set the torch on the table , pushing the surgical rotary saw aside to make room , and picked up a red suede muzzle designed to keep victims silent that victor had gotten from a bondage store .	1
with a final glance at his victim , he approached el chilango , humming a song hed heard that morning .	1
waltzing matilda .	1
for whatever reason it had stayed with him , the melody catchy in an odd way .	1
shortly thereafter he began his first film appearance in earnest .	1
three hours later , victors phone rang .	1
its done .	1
dispose of the remains and hose down the shop .	1
thanks for everything , el rey said , before hanging up .	1
hed settled up with victor earlier , so there were no worries in that respect .	1
he studied the three small video cassettes and labeled them one through three with a fine-tip marker , then slipped them into his pocket before turning off the work area lights .	1
he was glad he wouldnt have to clean up after the mess it was all hed been able to do to avoid getting soaked with blood in the end .	1
the dismemberment and cauterization had been gratuitous , but then again his little cinematic epic was intended for a very specific audience .	1
he suspected what it lacked in finesse would be made up by the subject matter .	1
hed stretched things out as long as they would go and , fortunately , el chilango had been healthy and strong .	1
it was amazing the amount of abuse the human body could take and still keep functioning .	1
still , when all was said and done , nothing lasted forever .	1
el rey limped down the street , still humming , his leg starting to throb but still largely numb from the two injections .	1
hed get out of town in the late morning and be back home within twenty hours of taking off , with any luck at all .	1
a few minutes later , he saw the lights of his hotel and exhaled with relief at the thought of a few hours of rest .	1
it had been a long day .	1
the qantas first class lounge was mostly empty so el rey had the area he was sitting in all to himself .	1
he nibbled on some cashews and drank some more orange juice while gazing through the window at the huge airplanes landing as he waited for his flight to be called .	1
his leg hurt like hell , but hed be fine .	1
he didnt want to take any pain medicine but reconciled to perhaps availing himself of the expensive free alcohol that flowed like water in the first class cabin .	1
it wasnt like he would need to be in total control while thirty-nine thousand feet over the pacific ocean .	1
it would be safe to violate his prohibition against alcohol in cases of emergency .	1
it was , after all , for legitimate medicinal reasons .	1
fortunately , his seat pod folded flat into a bed , so he would be able to sleep for much of the way if he had any luck at all .	1
the trip over had been relatively smooth and he was hopeful that it would be equally uneventful on the return across the pacific as well .	1
his english was more than good enough to follow the dialogue in the in-flight films , so he could catch a movie or two while waiting to drift off .	1
he never watched tv or movies back home , so it was a guilty pleasure he planned to indulge while aloft .	1
the el chilango contract would be the last of the year for him .	1
he wanted to recuperate from the shooting , and also not be overly available to any of the cartels preferring to select the assignments he accepted with care .	1
he wouldnt get to the point where he could command millions for a hit by being open to every job thrown his way .	1
he intended to only take the truly challenging sanctions , thereby creating a reputation as a man who could do the impossible the court of last resort when only the best would do .	1
that would take as much stagecraft and pomp as it would competent execution .	1
everything in the end was a performance , and if he managed his career correctly he would soon be the star of center stage when it came to headline-making assassinations .	1
the loudspeaker announced his flight and an attractive young redheaded australian woman came to assist him with the wheelchair that sat waiting in a corner .	1
hed told the airline that he was disabled , a diving accident , and the staff had been more than accommodating .	1
as the perky airline worker pushed him to the gate , he again remarked at how clean everything was in sydney .	1
it wasnt home , of course , but australia certainly had its charms .	1
he could understand the appeal as a retirement destination , although for the life of him he couldnt figure out what the people were saying half the time .	1
once onboard , he stowed his overnight bag and settled in for the long journey ahead .	1
he had booked a seat at the very front of the 747 , with nobody in front of him , and he hoped the section would be only a third full , as it had been on the way over .	1
eventually the door closed and he saw , with satisfaction , that nobody else was in his row .	1
thankfully , hed be left in peace .	1
el rey plugged his headphones into the center console and adjusted the channel to the classical station , then thumbed through the onboard magazine to see what had been selected for his viewing pleasure by the attentive entertainment concierge at qantas .	1
a grinning stewardess came down the aisle and offered him a glass of veuve clicquot champagne , which he gratefully accepted while returning the womans smile .	1
she brought it promptly , along with a porcelain bowl of warm , mixed nuts , and reminded him to simply ask if he had any other requests or needs .	1
he leaned back in his seat with a weary sigh as he sipped the bubbly ambrosia from the glass flute , and peered through the window while the plane backed away from the gate .	1
shaking out an iron pill and antibiotic , he washed them down with the last of the elixir , and before long the massive aircraft was lumbering down the runway and up into the cold morning light .	1

foreword king of swords is a work of fiction .	1
any resemblance between the characters and real people , living or dead , is coincidental .	1
having said that , the backdrop and historical context of the novel is based in fact .	1
the drug war in mexico has been an ongoing confrontation between government forces and the ever-strengthening cartels now the largest illegal drug trafficking network in the world , whose primary target market is the united states .	1
thousands of police and soldiers have been killed over the last ten years , as the war has intensified due to a crackdown by pro-u.s. administrations .	1
cartel members slaughter one another by the thousands each year , as well as huge numbers of innocent bystanders .	1
the brutality of the turf wars that are a constant and ongoing facet of the trade is stunning ; well over a thousand children have been butchered during the last decade , as have countless family members of traffickers , killed in retribution or as a deterrent .	1
the last two secretaries of the interior for mexico died in suspicious air crashes .	1
the sinaloa cartel is real .	1
the knights templar cartel is also real , as is the gulf cartel , the tijuana cartel , and los zetas cartel .	1
new cartels pop up when the heads of the old groups die , and the names change with some frequency .	1
the only constant is the bloodshed ; the natural consequence of the economics of trafficking in an illegal substance that generates in excess of fifty billion dollars a year , wholesale , for the cartels in mexico : a country where the average person makes a hundred and sixty dollars a month .	1
a description of the tarot card , the king of swords in full regalia , the king of swords sits proudly on his throne with a long , upward-pointing , double-edged sword clutched in his right hand , and his left hand resting lightly on his lap .	1
a ring adorns his left saturn finger representing power and commitment to responsibility .	1
the kings blue tunic symbolizes a desire for spiritual enlightenment ; his purple cape symbolizes empathy , compassion and intellect .	1
the backrest of his throne is embellished with butterflies , signifying transformation , and crescent moons orbit around an angel situated by his left ear , positioned , perhaps , to lend a delicate guidance .	1
the backdrop of the sky has very few clouds , signifying pragmatic mental clarity .	1
the trees dotting the landscape stand still , with not a rustle reflecting the king of swords stern judgment .	1
king of swords reversed the reversed king of swords depicts a man who is ruthless or excessively judgmental ; when reversed , the king of swords suggests the misuse of mental power , authority and drive .	1
the reversed king of swords can represent manipulation and persuasion in order to achieve selfish ends .	1
he is a very intelligent character who likes to demonstrate to others his superiority , either verbally or through actions .	1
it is best to be wary of this type of person because , although he may be charming and intelligent , he is remorseless and can do only harm .	1
he has only his personal interests in mind and will do whatever necessary to achieve those interests , even if it means destroying others .	1
introduction three years ago , pacific coast , mexico armed men lined the perimeter of the large contemporary home on the secluded stretch of seashore just north of punta mita , twenty-three miles north of puerto vallarta .	1
the stunning single-level example of modern mexican architecture sat overlooking a cove , where the heavy surf from the pacific ocean flattened out over the shallow offshore reef a hundred yards from the beach .	1
nine-foot-high concrete walls ringed the compound , protecting the occupants from prying eyes and would-be intruders .	1
not that any were in evidence .	1
the property and the coastline for a quarter mile in each direction belonged to the houses secretive owner julio guzman salazar , the jalisco cartels chief and the eighth richest man in mexico , although his name didnt appear on any roster other than the governments most wanted list .	1
the buildings ricardo legorreta design boasted thirty-eight thousand feet of interior space , with nine bedrooms in the main house , separate servants quarters adjacent to the twelve car air-conditioned garage , a full sized movie theater with a floating floor , its own solar and wind power generation system , and a full time domestic staff of eleven .	1
an olympic-sized swimming pool with an infinity edge finished in indigo mirrored glass tile created the illusion of water spilling into the deep blue ocean .	1
the white cantera stone pool-area deck took on a pale cosmic glow as the last sliver of sun sank into the watery horizon , making way for the dark of a late-november night .	1
the armed men encircling the house were hardened and efficient , exuding a palpable air of menace as they roamed the grounds , alert for threats .	1
the security detail , which traveled with salazar everywhere he went , consisted of eighteen seasoned mercenaries who were proficient with the assault rifles they held with nonchalant ease .	1
motion detectors provided an early warning system outside of the walls , where infrared beams crisscrossed the expanse between the beach and the house , ensuring that nothing could penetrate the elaborate defenses undetected .	1
salazar could afford the best security money could buy , and his private army comprised not only mexicans and nicaraguans and colombians , but also two south africans and a croatian .	1
all had seen more than their share of combat , either of the civilian variety in the ongoing drug skirmishes between rival cartels , or in full-scale armed conflict in the balkans or africa .	1
at seven p.m. precisely , the bright halogen headlights of expensive vehicles began making their way down the long road from the coastal highway that connected puerto vallarta with mazatlan , and through the enormous gates of the opulent home .	1
each car was allowed inside to drop off its passengers after undergoing scrutiny from the guards charged with salazars protection , who inspected the suvs inside and out .	1
during the next hour , seven humvees and escalades discharged their loads before pulling back out of the compound and parking in a brightly lit area designated for the purpose .	1
two armed gunmen patrolled the flat expanse , weapons cocked and loaded .	1
in the constant drug battles that were the norm on mainland mexico , every minute held the possibility of instant death for those in the trade , and so the men on the security team were in a constant state of readiness for attack .	1
their vigilance had paid off many times over the past decade , when rival factions had attempted to challenge salazars stranglehold on the jalisco trafficking corridor .	1
hed emerged victorious from that series of ever-escalating brutal engagements , the last of which had culminated in nineteen corpses beheaded or shot execution-style in culiacan over a three month period .	1
the sinaloa cartel was one of the most powerful in the world , and for some time had nurtured aspirations of expanding its lethal tentacles into jalisco , the neighboring state to the south salazars home turf .	1
the sinaloa cartel controlled much of the marijuana produced in mexico and had grown to be the largest cocaine and heroin trafficking entity in the world , handling over seventy percent of all colombian product that made it into the u.s. salazars operation was considerably smaller , but the brutality of his tactics made him a difficult adversary to encroach upon ; after ten years of unsuccessful attempts to execute him , an uneasy truce now held sway .	1
the lush , planted areas of the compound were lavishly appointed .	1
the beachside pool decks verdant landscaping was circled with the flicker of tiki torches placed there for the big event that was just getting underway .	1
an eighteen-piece mariachi band in full regalia had assembled by the massive palapa over the hotel-sized outdoor pool bar .	1
the musicians aired their traditional music for the guests , who were almost exclusively children and their mothers .	1
it was salazars oldest sons seventh birthday ; the party was an important event .	1
attendees had come from as far as mexico city to honor julio juniors big day .	1
there was a giddy sense of privilege and wealth in the festivities the boy had been presented with a pony , along with every imaginable video game and technological miracle a young man could wish for .	1
clowns and acrobats japed and tumbled around the sidelines , performing astounding feats of dexterity and contortionism amid long bursts of yellow flame from a troupe of fire-breathers .	1
peals of adolescent laughter punctuated the melody of strumming guitars and blaring horns and violins , while the women circled the childrens area clutching pia coladas and daiquiris in their lavishly bejeweled hands .	1
all the guests knew one another salazars social circle was small and exclusive .	1
off to the side , salazar and a handful of his closest male friends and associates stood beside a fifteen-foot-diameter fire pit , smoking cuban cigars and drinking five-hundred dollar tequila from brandy snifters as they discussed business in hushed tones , occasionally glancing a watchful eye over their wives and offspring .	1
salazar was easily distinguished from the group due to his height and distinctive facial hair he was barely five four , and sported a lincolnic beard in the fashion that his father had affected until hed died in a car crash when salazar was nine years old .	1
two female dancers in traditional folk garb approached the specially erected stage with a male dancer in the classic mexican vaquero outfit , who executed a series of exhibition tricks with a lasso , dancing with the whirling rope to the delight of the assembled children .	1
when he was finished , the trio remained on the stage .	1
a spotlight flicked on .	1
from a newly pitched tent adjacent to the pool , a man in a black suit emerged , flamboyantly brandishing a large sombrero .	1
he bowed to the arc of enraptured kids before finally placing it onto the head of the birthday boy .	1
the crowd laughed and clapped in mutual surprise this was one of mexicos most beloved singers , popular for two decades before salazars son had been born .	1
he swiveled and moved onto the performance area with a practiced ease and began singing one of his most famous ballads , a perennial favorite with young and old alike .	1
the adults sang along and clapped , as did the children , who were captivated by the theatrical production numbers and the pomp of the event .	1
a small prop plane meandered along the coastline at an altitude of nine thousand feet , its lights extinguished , its radar off and its radio silent .	1
the pilot held up a hand with two fingers extended , and then watching his digital timer , made a curt gesture , signaling to the man in the rear that it was time .	1
the passenger , dressed head to toe in black and with a balaclava covering his face , nodded and gripped the lever of the sliding door on the fuselages side , twisting it and forcing it open .	1
he was instantly buffeted by a blast of warm air which tore at his clothes and burned his eyes , until he pulled a pair of night vision goggles into place and hurled himself into the dark , rushing void .	1
the wind clawed at him as he tumbled through the night sky , the planes droning engine inaudible over the howl of the wind .	1
after counting to twenty , he pulled the handle of his specially configured parachute harness and whumped to a near halt , the straps straining at the arrest of his descent .	1
a black rectangular glider-parachute billowed above him as he manipulated it with two handles , until he quickly got his fall under control and directed himself at the glowing patch of coastline where the party would now be in full swing .	1
he glanced at the luminous hands of his oversized military-blackened panerai watch and smiled under the woolen mask .	1
so far everything was going according to plan .	1
a few minutes later he could make out the flat roof of the main house , where three armed sentries watched the proceedings by the pool and scanned the beach for threats .	1
he was now barely fifteen hundred feet above the compound .	1
even at that altitude , he could hear the music and singing , and make out the shrieks of glee from the children as they chased each other around the party tables to the bouncing melody of the band .	1
as hed hoped , the volume of the musicians drowned out any hint of flapping from his chute .	1
the rooftop security men were engrossed with the show , so were unlikely to look up .	1
he connected the right control cable handle to a clasp on the harness , which made steering more difficult but was essential to momentarily freeing his hand .	1
from a strap on his chest , he grappled with the grip of an mtar-21 compact assault rifle : a small , evil-looking weapon with a silencer and flash suppressor .	1
the gun was affixed to the harness with a three-foot nylon rope to prevent an inadvertent loss during the nocturnal descent .	1
he groped until he felt the familiar pistol grip and trigger guard , and flipped the safety off .	1
he was now two hundred feet above the roof at the far end of the house the three sentries were still on the beach side of the roof , watching the entertainment and scanning the surf line .	1
when he was twenty yards above the men , his weapon belched three short bursts , catching all three guards unawares and ending their lives before they could register any surprise .	1
his feet alighted on the waterproofed concrete surface next to them , and he immediately reeled in the chute , securing it in place with one of the guards guns after shrugging out of the harness .	1
eighty feet away , on the far end of the roof , a gathering of gulls stood with a black bird a raven or crow in their midst , silently observing the new arrival from the sky .	1
a sound from below startled them , and the gulls scattered into the evening sky .	1
the black bird remained , as if undecided , and then with a squawk also flung itself into the night .	1
the assassin stole his way , catlike , to the corner of the house nearest the beach and carefully unpacked the contents of his backpack , extracting two spare 32-round magazines for the gun , a black nylon rope with a grappling-hook , three grenades and four smoke grenades , a fiber optic scope on the end of a black aluminum telescoping rod , a heavily modified sniper rifle with a collapsible stock , a silencer and ten-round magazine for it , and a waterproof camera .	1
he slipped one of the magazines into a pocket on the side of his pants , along with the camera , and turned his attention to the sniper weapon .	1
inspecting the rifle and confirming it was intact , he drew several deep breaths , preparing himself for what was to come .	1
he carefully threaded the silencer onto the barrel and unfolded the carbon-fiber stock , then inserted the magazine and silently eased back the precision-machined bolt , chambering a round .	1
ready now , he flipped the night vision headgear up and out of his line of sight and peered through the telescoping fiber optic lens at the festivities below .	1
he quickly located the group of male guests and confirmed salazar was among them .	1
satisfied that his quarry was in his kill zone , he surveyed the rest of the deck and spotted three security guards unobtrusively standing in the shadows at the base of the portable lighting towers that illuminated the party .	1
returning his attention to salazar , he calculated the distance and the strength of the light breeze not that it would make much difference on a shot that was no more than sixty yards ; it was force of habit .	1
one of the fallen sentries radios crackled as a coarse voice intruded , demanding a status report .	1
he reached over and turned the volume down , then returned his focus to the celebration , this time peering over the edge of the roof through the scope of the rifle .	1
salazar was gesturing at the famous singer like an orchestra conductor , singing along with him , obviously well on the road to inebriation , when the top of his head blew apart , speckling his entourage with bloody shards of bone and brains .	1
he crumpled soundlessly , his limbs slack , dead before his brutalized head slammed against the ground .	1
a second ticked by as the shocked group registered what had happened , even as the band continued playing , unaware that the party had just come to an abrupt end .	1
the farthest security guard lurched backwards , dropping his gun as he died , and then the screaming from the crowd began .	1
the other two sentries swiveled around with weapons in hand , searching for assailants .	1
a slug tore the second guards throat out as it sheared through his spine , and the third guards chest erupted blood even as he wheeled around to his fallen associate .	1
pandemonium reigned as the women ran crying towards the house with their terrified children in tow .	1
the band fell silent and hurriedly made for cover behind the concrete pool bar , instruments clattering against the deck stone as they took flight .	1
a large exhibition light on the periphery exploded in a shower of sparks , then the other three quickly followed suit , and finally the spotlight shattered , leaving only the torch flames and a few indirect wall sconces on the house .	1
salazars friends had rushed to their families and were herding them to safety inside , leaving the expansive pool deck empty save for the band and the trembling entertainers .	1
on the roof , the uninvited guest tossed the rifle onto a dead guards chest and methodically lobbed the grenades over the front of the house , not looking to see where they landed , their detonations ample evidence theyd found a mark where the rest of the guards had been stationed .	1
he raced back to the beach side of the roof , pulled the pins on the smoke grenades and threw them onto the right side of the pool deck , allowing the breeze to waft a dense fog over the area .	1
satisfied with the effect , he wedged the steel hook into the concrete roof lip and tossed the line down to the ground .	1
he scanned the walkway that ran along the walls edge to confirm there were no armed assailants immediately proximate , and swung his legs over the side , sliding down the rope to a flagstone , where he landed in a crouch .	1
from the plants at the side of the deck , the dead guards radios crackled with panicked orders as he moved through the smoke to the fire pit , where salazars corpse lay sprawled face down on the white cantera in a pool of blood .	1
he hauled on a shoulder and flipped the body onto its back , then fished in his pants for the tarot card that was his signature .	1
carefully balancing the image of a crowned man holding a sword on the cartel kingpins mangled face , he took two pictures with the little camera before returning it to his pants pocket , then reached down and stuck the card in salazars gaping mouth so that he could be sure it wouldnt blow away during the ensuing action .	1
peering through the billowing clouds that largely obscured the house , he pulled the tab on his last smoke grenade and tossed it onto the sand , enveloping the beach with an impenetrable haze .	1
a hail of bullets tore a chunk of stone from the deck a few feet from him ; he swiveled in a crouch and fired a few short bursts from his silenced assault rifle in the direction of the barking male voices .	1
another bullet ricocheted off the fire pit , signaling that it was time to make his departure .	1
the surviving guards from the front of the house were closing in , and even he was reluctant to take on over a dozen armed men in a wide-open gunfight .	1
he unclipped a final grenade from his backpack chest strap and pulled the pin , flipping it roughly thirty feet towards the house , and then unclipped the mtar-21 , emptied the magazine in the direction of the approaching guards and tossed it aside , satisfied with the screams of pain from their direction .	1
he wrenched the night vision goggles off his head and threw them as far as he could before turning to run for the beach .	1
the grenades concussion delivered yet another delay for his pursuers the shrapnel from the explosion would stop any chase long enough for him to get a thirty second lead , which was all he needed .	1
he sprinted to the water line across the luminescent sand and without hesitation dived into the mild surf , swimming energetically as he strained towards the mouth of the cove .	1
a beam of light played across the water from the beach , and he sensed bullets shredding through the waves around him as he plowed further from shore .	1
counting to himself , he swam submerged for twenty seconds at a time , coming up for gulps of air before plunging into the safety of the deep .	1
once he was past the partially-submerged spit of land at the mouth of the cove he angled to the right , and within a few moments reached a slimy outcropping of rocks a hundred yards from the angry killers on the shore .	1
he fumbled around in the dark until he found the smooth fiberglass side of the black jet ski hed secured there the night before and hurriedly tore the camouflage fabric from its sleek hull and freed it from the barnacle-covered stones .	1
the tide had risen to the point where the small watercraft slid easily onto the waves , and within seconds the engine fired and he tore off into the sea , jumping easily over the surf that roiled atop the reef line .	1
a few bursts of distant rifle fire chattered across the water but he was already out of range the shooting was little more than a lament from the thwarted security .	1
savoring the adrenaline rush as he flew over the small swells at fifty miles per hour , he reached beneath his chin and pulled the soaking balaclava over his face , jettisoning it into the pacific as he plotted a course south , where a vehicle waited on a lonely stretch of beach for his nocturnal arrival .	1
tonight would be the stuff of legends , he knew .	1
in a business where money flowed like water , hed just pulled off the impossible in a spectacular and flamboyant manner .	1
after this , hed be able to command whatever fee he wanted , and there would be an international waiting list of eager clients .	1
hed left the card in salazars maw to seal the deal and continue to build his reputation .	1
it had started years ago , as an idea hed gotten from an article hed read about the american war in the middle east , where the kill squads assigned playing cards to each target they were hunting .	1
hed liked the idea , but had taken it one step further with a unique flourish .	1
when hed begun his career as contract killer , hed made a point of leaving a tarot card with a depiction of the king of swords on it the significance of which was known only to him and hed adopted a nickname that now struck fear into the hearts of those he targeted .	1
king of swords .	1
el rey de espadas .	1
or as the press had taken to calling him , el rey .	1
it might have been a little melodramatic , but nobody was laughing now that his legacy of impossible kills was the stuff of front page headlines .	1
not since the exploits of carlos the jackal had an assassin gained such notoriety , and hed carefully selected the contracts hed taken for maximum publicity value , in addition to the money .	1
hed quickly developed a reputation as a phantom , an invisible man a contract arranged with him was as good as putting a bullet in the targets brain at the time the deal was negotiated .	1
el rey was a star , a legend , and even his clients approached him with a certain trepidation when they required his services .	1
these were generally men who butchered whole communities to make a point , but who deferred to el rey out of respect .	1
hed earned it the hard way , by taking the sanctions that were considered impossible and then delivering .	1
in his circles , respect was won at the edge of a knife blade or the barrel of a gun .	1
it was blood currency .	1
and now , he could name his price .	1
tonights logistics had cost him just under a hundred thousand dollars the contract price had been two and a half million .	1
not a bad evenings work .	1
but after this , his rate would start at four million and quickly increase from there , depending on the level of difficulty .	1
off to his left , the lights of punta mitas expansive coastline sparkled in the overcast night .	1
some of the homes along that stretch of beach cost well over five million dollars , he knew .	1
rich gringos and successful narcotraficantes were the only ones who could afford them , and with a little luck , soon he would be part of the elite that called the area home .	1
but hed need to do a few more jobs before he could hang up his tail and horns and call it quits , and he was in no hurry to retire .	1
el rey loved the adrenaline rush of the kill ; the more planning involved and the greater the level of challenge , the better .	1
he glanced down at the dimly illuminated compass hed mounted beneath the handles and made a small adjustment to his course , musing at the direction his life had taken as he sliced through the inky water , effortlessly making his escape into the warm tropical night .	1
prologue two years ago , puebla , mexico the central square in downtown puebla was typical of larger mexican towns ; a cultural hub for the community as well as a gathering place .	1
tourists from all over the country traveled to visit the cathedral adjacent to the square ; the area was one of the most picturesque in the region .	1
a steady procession of cars cruised around the city center , although traffic was kind in the early afternoon .	1
a light breeze rustled through the trees that sheltered picnickers from the harsh sunlight as they languished on the freshly trimmed grass , the faint aroma of delectables from the nearby restaurants wafting across the common like a gastronomic siren song .	1
rosa sat at one of the quaint cafs with her daughter , cassandra , eating fresh fruit sorbet .	1
it was summer , so school was out , and they were visiting rosas parents for a week a refreshing break from the press of humanity in mexico city , which was among the largest cities in the world , and the place she reluctantly called home .	1
the weather was hot , but not punishingly so , and free from the oppressive pollution that hung like a blanket over the valley where mexico city resided .	1
some of the air quality problems were a function of geography , and some were due to the virtual absence of any emission control on cars until recently .	1
the capital of mexico was surrounded by hills , which prevented the thermal layer of un-breathable toxins from dispersing .	1
it was one of natures cruel tricks that so many people lived in an area where breathing the air was the equivalent of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day .	1
she wished that they could move , maybe to guadalajara , where the weather was usually nice and the verdant region of lake chapala was little more than an hour away , but her husbands job wouldnt allow for that .	1
she hated that they were locked into living in their little three bedroom row house in toluca , near the airport , in a neighborhood that seemed chronically victimized by crime ; but life wasnt always fair or easy and they were doing the best they could .	1
rosa had a decent career as an insurance agent for her own small agency , and between her income and her husbands they did as well as they could expect , but sometimes she was affected by a sense of melancholy , especially as she watched her eight-year-old daughter growing up in less than ideal conditions .	1
cassandra had been a kind of miracle ; rosas doctor had convinced her that she would never be able to carry a baby to term due to a host of chronic immuno-deficiencies , but a strong faith in god and skilled care at the hospital had brought cassandra howling into the world , where shed been rosas pride and joy ever since .	1
glancing at her daughter , rosa brushed cassandras hair out of her eyes , and using a corner of her napkin , wiped away a smudge of strawberry from the little girls upturned lips .	1
cassandra cass gave rosa a look of embarrassment and hastily rubbed her forearm across her face .	1
rosa smiled at the gesture .	1
that was another way to do it , she supposed .	1
a policeman on patrol tipped his cap to the pair as he strolled by ; she returned his smile out of courtesy .	1
a striking example of classical mexican beauty , with flashing eyes the color of espresso and black hair that shimmered like silk against her caf-au-lait-complexioned skin , she was accustomed to admiring attention from men , even though shed long ago pledged her heart and soul to her husband the love of her life .	1
cass had inherited her stunning features , but with an unexpected twist of dirty blond hair a testament to her fathers partial german lineage several generations back .	1
even now , barely an adolescent , she was a gorgeous child , and rosa knew she was destined to break hearts when she blossomed .	1
it was not out of the question that she could be a model once she hit her teens ; a few of rosas friends had already said as much .	1
as they watched the cars go by and the kids playing on the square , both mother and daughter felt happy to be relaxed in a place that was safe and relatively unspoiled .	1
theyd just finished lunch at a small restaurant at the base of one of the old hotels facing the church , enjoying the best chicken mole poblano rosa had tasted in years .	1
mole sauce was more of an art than a recipe , and each region had its own take on the dish .	1
in puebla , the sauce was nearly black , as thick as liquid tar , redolent of chocolate and clove and thirty-something other spices and ingredients .	1
it was a rich and heady dish , and few restaurants could pull it off as well as the one theyd dined at .	1
puebla was one of the meccas of mexican culinary accomplishment , and mole poblano was a signature pueblan specialty .	1
cass had busied herself naming the pigeons that paraded and strutted across the street in the square , and one particularly unctuous example of male avian belligerence had captured her attention .	1
shed announced to rosa that his name was el guero the pale one .	1
the bird was almost blindingly white and had a remarkable presence ; a swagger in each step and with chest puffed out , he fanned his wings and tail feathers in a display of mating finery .	1
the smaller gray females were clearly impressed with his moves , as was cass .	1
back and forth he swooped , cooing loudly as he pranced , the bird king of the puebla park holding court for his admiring subjects .	1
finished with their post-prandial treat , mother and daughter left the vicinity of the square and made their way to the parking lot where theyd left their car a peugeot that had never seemed to run correctly since the day theyd bought it new , on payments that amounted to twenty percent annual interest .	1
rosa hated the little blue beast , and was counting the days until it was paid for so they could sell it and get something more reliable .	1
two blocks from the square , an ivory ford expedition pulled to the curb beside them , and two men who had been following a few yards behind abruptly grabbed the pair and forced them towards the rear door .	1
rosa screamed , as did cassandra , who also kicked and tried to bite her assailants arm .	1
one of the men punched rosa hard enough to break her nose in an effort to stop the yelling , before he manhandled her to the vehicle .	1
there was sparse pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk , but the few people who saw the altercation stopped walking , frozen in place .	1
kidnappings were an unfortunate and all too regular feature of some larger mexican cities , and the armed gangs that specialized in it were not to be trifled with .	1
shootouts were not uncommon , because those drawn to the profession were typically violent and desperate , with nothing much to lose .	1
the man who had punched rosa pinned her on the rear seat while the other man lifted the struggling , screaming cassandra and stuffed her next to her mother .	1
one kidnapper got in back with the pair ; the other climbed into the front passenger seat .	1
the truck roared off down the street in a cloud of exhaust and a squealing of tires .	1
it had no license plate , a not particularly rare occurrence for those who didnt want to pay registration fees , so there were no immediately identifying marks other than a description of a large white ford suv .	1
the man in the rear seat slapped duct tape over cassandras mouth , then reached over and did the same with rosa .	1
the abductor in the passenger seat trained a pistol on rosas head , convincing her quickly that creating further havoc could be a fatal miscalculation .	1
cassandra sobbed into the tape , terrified of what was happening and what was likely to come .	1
twenty-five minutes after being snatched off the street in broad daylight , their assailants threw rosa and cassandra down a flight of stairs into a basement with a filthy mattress and a broken sewer line evacuating into one of the corners .	1
the stink was overpowering , and once the tape had been torn from their mouths , cassandra vomited all over herself , infuriating the four men who descended the stone stairs a few minutes later .	1
the largest of them slammed her against the far wall and issued angry instructions to one of his subordinates , who quickly returned with a hose from the garden immediately outside the basement entrance .	1
rosa attempted to shield her daughter , but the large man grabbed her by the hair and punched rosa in the stomach , knocking the wind out of her and crippling her with pain .	1
she collapsed on the floor , helpless , and two of the men alternated kicking her with their pointy-toed cowboy boots .	1
after a few blows , she mercifully slipped into unconsciousness .	1
even so , the men continued to rain kicks on her until they tired of the sport and turned their attention to the young girl .	1
a stream of cold water struck cassandra in the face .	1
the men laughed as she screamed in fear and rage at the shock , as well as the vision of her mothers inert form in the filth on the dank basement floor .	1
once the vomit had rinsed clean , the large man approached her huddled shape as she shivered , soaked and terrified , and tore her dress off , ripping the thin fabric as though it was tissue .	1
grunting , he lifted her like a rag doll and threw her onto the stained mattress .	1
stunned , she cried in panicked horror as the men circled her in preparation for the afternoons diversion .	1
the large man fumbled with his belt , and the others smiled in anticipation as cassandras unholy shrieks reverberated off the uncaring walls of her private hell .	1
two days later , a package arrived at rosas husbands work with his name written carefully on the label in black felt pen , with a return address in puebla that of rosas parents .	1
a local courier brought the box in and the receptionist signed for it , then instructed the mail boy to take it to his office , where he was preparing for a staff meeting with his immediate subordinates .	1
no one working that day would ever forget the screams of horror and grief that emanated from his office when he opened the special delivery .	1
inside , wrapped in plastic and surrounded by crushed newspaper , were cassandras and rosas heads , neatly severed at the third cervical vertebra , with their eyes crudely sewn shut .	1
each had the brand of a scorpion seared into their foreheads , and the tail of a scorpion protruded from their mouths , where the predatory arthropods had been lodged as calling cards .	1
~ ~ ~ four months ago , durango , mexico the crowd broke into a rousing cheer as hector de la silva took the podium at the rally .	1
long one of the more popular governors in mexican history , his term had passed without him seeking re-election his aspirations for the presidency as the likely successor to mexicos highest office quite obvious .	1
hed already begun the convoluted and colorful campaigning that made mexican elections something of a spectacle the fiery rhetoric and accusations vivid and damning , the promises lofty and inspiring .	1
nobody actually believed anything the candidates said history had shown that no matter who was in power , the campaign promises were immediately forgotten as soon as the voting was over , but the process was celebrated for the showmanship and sense of theater .	1
hector , or el gallo as he was known the rooster was in his element ; a consummate performer from decades of holding political office , he knew how to play to a crowd like a virtuoso .	1
he was famous for slamming his forehead into the podium when his speech reached its climax , underscoring the sacrifice he was prepared to make on behalf of his constituency the head-banging routine was now as popular and expected as the flip off the top rope in the mexican wrestling matches : the lucha libre , where masked wrestlers-cum-gymnasts performed amazing feats of physical dexterity as they pretended to fight each other .	1
nobody believed that was real , either , and yet it was hugely popular , trailing only soccer for entertainment value .	1
the assembled spectators waited in quivering anticipation as el gallo mounted the stage , clad in an everyman ranchers shirt and sporting a cowboy hat .	1
this was a man of the people , a member of the masses , he assured them , even as his four hundred dollar ostrich-skin boots gleamed in the sunlight .	1
never mind that his brothers were among the wealthiest landowners in the region , or that his father had been a household name in building low-income housing .	1
forget all that , his demeanor seemed to demand .	1
here was a humble , simple man , who reluctantly would shoulder the considerable burden of steering the nation back onto the path of righteousness , having somewhat lost its way though certainly not because of the actions of his political party , which was also the current presidents .	1
no , the country was in mortal peril because of a crisis in morality , exemplified by the surge in popularity and power of the drug cartels .	1
he cleared his throat and began to speak , a deep baritone long bent to the artifice of holding an audiences attention , well modulated , passion and intensity obvious in every syllable without any evidence of stridency .	1
this was a mans man , a visionary , a leader capable of finally , after centuries of oppression , delivering to the mexican people the promise of their legacy .	1
look at the prosperity mexico has enjoyed over the last few years .	1
under the partys leadership , a new , burgeoning middle class has been created , and poverty has been eradicated in many of its most pervasive forms .	1
our economy is the eleventh largest in the world , strong and resilient , like the mexican people , who have triumphed in the face of adversity and built a better future for our children !	1
el gallo proclaimed , emphasizing points by stabbing at the air with his hat .	1
the crowd burst into well-choreographed spontaneous applause , led by party agitators who were in attendance to galvanize cheering at the appropriate points .	1
the television cameras tracked over the thronged celebrants one could hardly watch the outpouring of enthusiasm without being moved .	1
i love my children , and i have taught them to love god , and mexico .	1
i like to think ive shown them the difference between right and wrong , between good and evil , between a road with promise and one that leads to purgatory .	1
children are the countrys future , and so we must do everything in our power to build a safe environment where they can excel .	1
they shouldnt have to worry about drug cartels shooting up the streets , or pushing their poison in our schools .	1
we can not give in to their terrorism .	1
not because its the right thing to do .	1
not because its the easy thing to do .	1
but because of the children .	1
we must do what it takes , for the children , for mexicos bountiful harvest of talent and hope !	1
a hunched figure adjusted the tripod of the high velocity rifle , watching as the oration hit full stride and the gathering of citizens applauded again .	1
the actual words were lost on him because he was behind the speakers , in the tower of the church five hundred yards from the optimistic assembly .	1
he was invisible to the security forces in place around the rally , the rifle recessed in one of the small rectangular openings of the towers pinnacle .	1
the gunman watched the red balloons that framed the stage for clues as to the amount and direction of any wind .	1
he was in luck .	1
the late spring gusts were nowhere in evidence .	1
it would be an easy shot .	1
he was startled by a car backfiring on the road below .	1
several security men ran in the direction of the percussive blast , accompanied by six soldiers .	1
they watched as an ancient farm truck rolled down the street , straining under its load of hay .	1
at the next intersection , the engine backfired again ; the group of gunmen exchanged relieved looks , laughing with merriment at their defense of el gallo from a poorly tuned v8 .	1
the sentries returned to their positions as the great man continued to paint his verbose vision of a bright new future .	1
a crow landed on the balustrade of the tower and fixed the man with its beady stare .	1
for a reason he couldnt define , he was momentary chilled ; the hair on his arms standing erect .	1
he wasnt a believer in omens or symbols , but lurking somewhere in his schooldays the crow was deemed a foreteller of bad luck .	1
an impression from his past nagged at him , tried to surface , but he shrugged it off he didnt have time to waste on being spooked by a bird .	1
the man grinned at his own imagination allowing a crow to throw him .	1
it would be a day of bad luck , all right , but not for him .	1
the crow bobbed its head several times , then pecked at the stone it was standing on before giving up on its project and flying away .	1
he reached into his pants pocket and extracted a pair of dense foam earplugs before setting them in front of him , along with a digital watch displaying the time .	1
he had thirty seconds .	1
checking to ensure that everything was in place , he compressed the plugs and inserted one into each ear before returning his attention to the florid man pontificating on the stage .	1
he seemed to be reaching a crescendo , and the gunman couldnt help but smile again .	1
this was going to be a funny one , if there ever had been .	1
he couldnt wait to see the papers tomorrow .	1
el gallo was building his intensity , railing against the cartels as the embodiment of satan crawling over the planet in human form .	1
the words were powerful , and the emotions high as his voice increased in volume .	1
these scum are a cancer on the body of the state ; they are toxic purveyors of poison and suffering .	1
they accommodate the demands of the rich gringos , who buy their products even as their own country collapses from the weight of its own excesses .	1
they have turned mexico into their whore , and its children into their slaves .	1
we suffer so that pimps and rich socialites can snort the devils dandruff during their orgies .	1
i would send a message to these traitors who suckle at the tit of the false god to the north .	1
i would send a telegram .	1
the message is , no longer will we be your burros or your lapdogs .	1
no more will you use our blood to lubricate your war machine .	1
we are mexican , and we are tired of being the back yard where you dump your problems , where you come to turn our daughters into prostitutes and our sons into groveling peasants .	1
your time is over , and we will now reclaim the bounty that is our birthright !	1
we are strong and proud .	1
and most of all , we are mexican .	1
we are family and we will be free !	1
the bells of the church began ringing , announcing the arrival of the noon hour , and el gallo , in fever pitch , slammed his head forward onto the podium in his now-famous trademark move .	1
the crowd burst into a spirited and hearty applause .	1
it was only when he slumped to the floor with blood spreading over the back of his hand-stitched white silk cowboy shirt that the screaming began .	1
the young novitiate moved with easy determination to the doors of the church as the pealing of the bells trumpeted gods grace and presence in everyday life .	1
an ancient woman crossed herself as he passed , her weathered face momentarily glowing with a devoted smile .	1
he turned when he reached the door and genuflected , his cassock brushing the ground as he crossed himself before the vision of an unfortunate savior crucified so that humanity could be saved , movingly depicted in the statue that dominated the wall above the altar .	1
the sun streaked through the elaborate stained glass windows over the door , bathing the interior in a dazzling multi-colored glow ; the nearly empty chamber radiated a tranquility that was regrettably absent from the cruel world just outside the doors .	1
with bible in hand , and fingering his rosary , he exited the house of worship and crossed the street ; a pious man on a mission to save the world .	1
twenty minutes later , the bodyguards and soldiers crept up the stairs to the tower top , guns at the ready as they strained their ears for any hint of threat .	1
the huge bells had fallen silent , and the only sound besides the scream of the sirens from the square across the wide boulevard was the cooing of amorous doves taking refuge in the tower rafters .	1
the leader of the team held up a hand in warning when he spotted the rifle , still on the tripod , a single spent shell casing lying by its side .	1
he grudgingly inched towards it ; the blood drained from his face as he saw the item held in place by the votive candle .	1
the stern countenance of the highly-stylized rendering of the royal presence seemed to sneer at the intruders , the brandished sword proclaiming to one and all the regal superiority of the seated man .	1
he approached the card as if in a trance , then reached down and retrieved the tattered rectangle , holding it up for his men to see .	1
the king of swords had struck again .	1

sometimes that happens to me in this place .	1
i dont think its memory loss or anything magical .	1
it just is .	1
when i say i suddenly found myself outside , well , thats really what happens .	1
my name is nick bazebahl .	1
yup , youre right , it sounds like a sport and i can live up to my name , no problem .	1
my dad thinks im the star of little league .	1
but back to the building i found myself in .	1
there were a lot of kids , mostly older than me .	1
taller , for sure .	1
they were busily moving around .	1
i saw a couple of guys step out of the giant round openings of what looked like room-sized washing machines .	1
front loaders .	1
i peered into one after some middle school kids turned the corner .	1
clothing was stuck to the far inside wall of the machine and had to be peeled off like velcro .	1
i know because thats what i did .	1
i peeled off some nice jeans and a dark blue tee-shirt .	1
i needed a new disguise .	1
stealing someones freshly washed laundry would have to do .	1
after all , i was pretty noticeable in this bright orange shirt and torn jeans .	1
but before i could change i suddenly found myself outside .	1
i walked around the building looking for an entrance and finally found one at the walk-out basement level .	1
a line of people stretched twenty feet or so with each person pushing a wheeled laundry basket .	1
you know the kind prisoners escape in them all the time on shows i watch when the babysitter is over .	1
just so you know , the babysitter is watching my younger sister , gracie .	1
anyway , i didnt think this was the way i had entered the first time .	1
darn , i knew there would be challenges when i came here .	1
i cut in line behind a woman with a skirt the size of my uncles pole barn .	1
no one complained that i took cuts .	1
they probably couldnt see me .	1
i took the first set of stairs up two flights and followed the woman as she went to the right .	1
it was habit , i guess , from following my mom ( not that my mom has a big butt , she doesnt ) .	1
this lady i was following went into a room with a swimming pool .	1
it was huge !	1
as she went to the changing room i took off the orange shirt and holey jeans right there .	1
i was glad to see i was wearing some fairly new underwear .	1
i wrapped myself in one of the softest white towels i had ever felt .	1
then i went looking for the giant washing machines again .	1
a towel disguise wouldnt be the smartest thing to run in , i know , but .	1
.	1
.	1
well , at least i wouldnt stand out .	1
strange as it seems almost everyone i passed was wearing a white towel .	1
i followed the winding hallway .	1
a hint of dryer lint and fabric softener in the air was guiding me .	1
then suddenly an announcement blared from speakers in the ceilings .	1
the monitors were here !	1
i didnt just need clothes now .	1
i needed a really quick escape route .	1
chapter 2 running down the hill i followed a woman that looked a lot like my mom ( smaller butt , long brown hair ) .	1
i watched her pull armloads of pants , shirts , underwear and sheets from one of the machines .	1
she heaped them in a pile on a long folding table and then went back to the giant machine .	1
she crouched and entered it .	1
it was really big .	1
i guess she had to peel off the stuff that got stuck to the back .	1
i took my chances and i grabbed what i wanted from the table .	1
i wanted anything blue , not pink .	1
not purple .	1
then i ducked into an open machine to change .	1
thats right .	1
these machines were bigger than the closets at our old apartment .	1
i was fast .	1
fast like you have five minutes , nick , before we have to leave for your ballgame not fast like the school bus will be here soon , you dont want to miss it , do you ?	1
i hurried to one of the small windows that looked out toward a fading sunset .	1
huh ?	1
this was weird .	1
i wasnt the only sloppy dressed kid trying to escape this place .	1
dozens of other kids were jumping out .	1
they were landing on the loose dirt and sand-surfing down the steep hillside .	1
most were in clothes too baggy or too tight .	1
lots of pink among the girls .	1
i wiggled through the opening and did the same surfing run down the hill .	1
my arms flapped at my sides as i tried to keep my balance .	1
everyone was running away from the building .	1
no one was yelling or screaming , not even the girls .	1
super weird .	1
it felt just like something was chasing us , but when i looked back all i saw was the red wall of that strange place .	1
suddenly , everything was dark .	1
chapter 3 the cliff i was in the woods now and the lights from the building didnt penetrate into the forest .	1
my eyes adjusted pretty quickly , though .	1
as i followed the others i noted that they were veering off in three separate directions .	1
a pair of kids , teenagers probably , were heading left followed by several moms , all plump .	1
( im not allowed to say fat . )	1
down the center trail went a bunch of girls .	1
now , finally , they were making noise , giggling .	1
i felt i better stick with the guys so i went right .	1
that meant i had to follow a guy in a soccer uniform .	1
good disguise , dog .	1
but i could barely see who he was following .	1
one last look behind and i knew i had just made it out of there in time .	1
the spotlights were scanning everywhere .	1
i turned and fell .	1
straight .	1
straight down .	1
straight down a slippery tube .	1
if i wasnt so scared i would have laughed and enjoyed the ride .	1
it lasted a full minute sixty microwave seconds and i felt hotter and hotter .	1
the sliding slowed as the tunnel evened out .	1
i had to crawl out the last three feet .	1
bazebahl , over here , someone whispered .	1
who could know my name ?	1
weve got a hard case here , she said .	1
she was an ageless woman , maybe thirty-five , maybe sixty .	1
she looked a lot like every teacher at my school .	1
her nametag said mabel jackson and i glanced down at my own chest to see that somehow i had a stick-on nametag , too .	1
it said nick bazebahl and had my picture , too .	1
it was my school picture , the retake from last spring with my hair about as short as its ever been .	1
when i looked up again i realized that the lady had just said something about a case .	1
a hard case ?	1
i echoed .	1
i dont know what youre talking about .	1
i couldnt imagine what she meant .	1
oh , yeah , thats right , youll have a little trouble with your memory for a while .	1
thatll pass .	1
just follow me for now , she said .	1
its almost midnight , we dont want to be late .	1
memory thing ?	1
well , that sort of made sense .	1
i could not in a million years figure out how i got here or what i was supposed to do .	1
i must be experiencing some kind of memory blackout .	1
cool .	1
i started following her .	1
i wondered what we were going to be late for .	1
and midnight ?	1
it was almost midnight ?	1
awesome .	1
i hope its a school night .	1
the sky got more black .	1
suddenly there was a boom of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in sheets .	1
miss jackson led me to a high , rocky bluff and we crouched down and looked over .	1
the straight river below held a steamboat trapped on a rock .	1
with every flash our eyes registered the progress of a small raft that was heading directly toward the boat .	1
thats jim !	1
i shouted to miss jackson , as i wiped my eyes and face clear of the cold rain .	1
i wondered how i knew it was jim .	1
jim who ?	1
of course , she answered .	1
and were here to save him and the little guy with him .	1
chapter 4 the growling i should have been confused by mabel jacksons statement , but , oddly , i knew she was right and we were definitely here on this bluff about to save two poor people on a raft .	1
double awesome .	1
i must have grown some new memories to replace the old or something .	1
but how were we going to save this jim and this little guy ?	1
we had no tools , no equipment of any kind .	1
at least i didnt .	1
i looked toward this nice lady and waited for the next flash of lightning .	1
and there it was .	1
flash !	1
ka-boom !	1
an image of her was burned into my eyes with hot redness .	1
her hair was plastered to her head .	1
there was a strap across her shoulder and a large bag under her arm .	1
whats in your bag ?	1
i asked , turning my attention back to the flickering boat lights below .	1
i could just make out the square shape of the raft entering a circle of light .	1
the usual , she said , ipad , knives , guns and for back up : paper and pencils .	1
did i hear right ?	1
oh , and a flashlight , of course , she added as she shined a narrow beam in my face .	1
then she fanned the light over my body and asked , wheres your bag ?	1
didnt you pick it up ?	1
my hesitation must have made her think i was somebody else , maybe , even though i had the right nametag .	1
are you nick ?	1
who are you ?	1
and then her flashlight glowed over the larger duffel bag behind me .	1
only a few scattered raindrops were splish-splashing on it now .	1
oh , there it is .	1
open it , would you ?	1
the zipper stuck every couple of inches , but i managed to force it open .	1
inside was another flashlight .	1
there was also a rope and a ton of rock climbing gear .	1
cool .	1
i could rock climb .	1
i went twenty feet up the rock wall at the indoor center .	1
higher than even matt jennings and it was his birthday party .	1
oops , i had to hurry .	1
the sound of the raft cracking up below was not the only reason i rushed to pull the supplies out .	1
the growling close to my left ear was louder than any mean german shepherd ive ever heard .	1
chapter 5 another tunnel as the growling grew louder and the snorts produced some foggy , and stinky , hot breaths , i slipped over the side of the cliff .	1
old miss or mrs. jackson was already below me , going down faster than youd think an old lady could go .	1
the crash of the waves below told me when i was near enough to look down .	1
its not a good idea to look down before youre still far enough to break a bone .	1
i caught some good footing and finished the drop by swinging into a cave .	1
yes , convenient , i know .	1
watch out , miss jackson said as she grabbed me around the waist and kept me from landing in , or rather diving through , the hole in the cave floor .	1
now listen .	1
the language we heard coming from the steamboat and the raft was really , really old fashioned .	1
kind of like the black and white movies my grandparents think we like to watch with them .	1
there was cussing and a whole lot of the n word .	1
i was really shocked , but miss jackson just kept scribbling notes .	1
my cousin has some really nasty rap stuff he let my brother and me listen to .	1
that is , until mom walked in .	1
anyway , this sort of sounded like that , but i didnt think my mom or grandma would have minded this as much .	1
it wasnt said mean-like or nothing .	1
somehow it fit .	1
start writing !	1
they trust us .	1
were doing good here .	1
miss jackson hissed , thrusting her paper and pencil at me .	1
she turned on her recording device and started capturing the dialogue .	1
i didnt see the point in my taking notes .	1
i couldnt write near as fast as she had been , or as well .	1
still , i got myself out of the tangle of the ropes and gave it my best shot .	1
it seemed to take hours and when i looked up we werent outside at all .	1
we were standing in an old-fashioned farmhouse bedroom , peering out from a crack in the nearly closed closet door .	1
an old woman with a bonnet on her head was shaking her finger at a boy coming out from under the bed , another boy was huddled under the sheets .	1
enough , jackson whispered , dropping her device into her bag .	1
she held it open for me to toss in the paper and pencil .	1
then she stepped back and disappeared through a hole in the floor .	1
but not before she grabbed my ankle .	1
i flew after her , bumping against the smooth sides of yet another tunnel .	1

next is the secret in the hidden cave chapter 1 the key .	1
it was suddenly very clear that the key in missys back pocket wasnt an ordinary key .	1
the rock ledge that she and jessica were on , wide enough for several more people but still high enough to make their stomachs jittery , wasnt an ordinary ledge either .	1
the rock ledge seemed artificially formed , although from a distance it would be impossible to detect that .	1
all of the gouges and pockmarks were actually impressions of different keys : large , small , thin , thick .	1
some indentations were deep , some were shallow , and all were spaced unevenly over the entire false rock face .	1
give me the key , missy , jessica panted , still out of breath from their climb , this has to be the way in .	1
well be able to save kevin and get out of here before they know were missing .	1
missy carefully took the key out of her pocket , this was not the place to be accidentally dropping things , and handed it to jessica who reached as high as she could to compare the key to the top left impression .	1
what do you think will happen if it fits ?	1
missy whispered .	1
think it will just automatically open ?	1
its worth a try .	1
jessica had dismissed the first several impressions and was slowly moving her hand down the rock , comparing the tiny indentations with the strange pattern of the key .	1
she held it between her thumb and first finger so she could find the match just as if she were doing another 500-piece puzzle , looking for the partner to the piece in her hand .	1
this is going to take a while .	1
there must be a thousand possibilities here .	1
suddenly both girls froze as they heard a rustling in the underbrush twenty or thirty feet below them .	1
missy needed to swat a mosquito but was afraid to move .	1
perched where they were they knew that from below they were invisible , but their voices would give them away .	1
had they been whispering too loudly ?	1
the mosquito that had been buzzing missys face had now moved to her knee and landed .	1
she glanced down and saw the tiny insect glistening gold in the afternoon sunlight .	1
she stared .	1
the mosquito really was golden and it was not about to bite her , but instead it seemed to be leading her to look to the last key mark near her foot .	1
pssssst , missy motioned to jessica and pointed out the key mark where the false rock met the ground .	1
jessica passed her the key and held her breath .	1
there was another sound below , a sort of humph , like someone clearing his throat .	1
missy bent down , crossed her fingers on her left hand and pressed the key hard into the rock outline with her right hand .	1
there was a whooshy sound , an inhuman sigh , and the false rock started to slowly open .	1
but it was pushing outward and missy had nowhere to step to from her crouching position .	1
she started to stand and move toward jessica who was stretching out her hand .	1
the rock door was pushing out and slowly upwards , too , but she wasnt sure if she could reach jessica or duck under the opening before it pushed her off the ledge .	1
what a stupid place to put the keyhole , she thought , there should be a better entrance !	1
she decided to try to cling to the bottom of the rock door as it swung out and up .	1
she grabbed at the indentations ; some were deep enough to provide a handhold .	1
her left hand seemed to have a good hold but her right hand scraped down and dislodged the key .	1
instinct made her grab for it before it fell forever lost below .	1
jessica gasped , look out , missy !	1
missy was losing her balance even though the door was no longer pushing outward only upward .	1
there was a loud mechanical grumble below them in the underbrush as well as a hoarse voice , definitely human , rasping : gotcha !	1
missy had heard stories about people whose whole lives flashed before their eyes when they thought they were about to die .	1
time seemed to slow way down but it wasnt her whole life that flashed before her .	1
she thought of march .	1
last march , when this unbelievable adventure had begun chapter 2 march missy had been doing her favorite thing : watching reruns and eating chips .	1
not potato chips , chocolate chips .	1
she didnt have any friends , not here anyway .	1
she had friends back home but it wasnt home anymore since her mom and she had moved from the nice warm south to this cooler state .	1
cold actually .	1
when they arrived in january it had been snowing and a blizzard had closed school on the first day she was going to go .	1
she probably shouldnt have complained so much about the cold and snow to her new classmates , or rather , she shouldnt have bragged about the 75-degree weather she had just left .	1
she had gotten off to a bad start but a few of the girls were starting to be friendlier , now that her tan had started to fade .	1
she was just thinking how her life was like this rerun she was watching , boring , predictable , when her mom came into the den and sat down next to her .	1
missy , this weekend were driving up north to visit someone , her mom said .	1
you mean theres someplace more north than here ?	1
yup , dont you want to know who were going to see ?	1
who ?	1
your fathers grandfather .	1
missys father died when she was four and she only had warm , fuzzy memories of a big , strong , nice-smelling man reading her stories .	1
she had met her grandparents lots of times but she didnt even realize that she had a great-grandfather .	1
he must be ancient .	1
very , her mother replied , he must be almost a hundred , but he still lives all by himself .	1
your dad didnt get to know him because your grandfather had had a big fight with him a long time ago and they quit speaking .	1
thats stupid .	1
i know , but anyway , your great-grandfather got in touch with me after your father died and ive been meaning to take you to see him for the last eight years .	1
it was always too far and we couldnt afford the trip , but now its just a four or five hour drive away .	1
well leave very early saturday morning .	1
sound like fun ?	1
not exactly , missy said and then saw the disappointed look on her mothers face .	1
she quickly added , but im sure it will be interesting .	1
yeah , right , she thought , some hundred-year-old stranger/relative is going to be interesting and fun .	1
early saturday morning they ate breakfast and packed sandwiches and drinks for a picnic along the way .	1
missy looked over her mothers shoulder and they both studied the road map that was unfolded on the kitchen table .	1
the majority of the trip would be mostly expressway but the last forty miles or so it was going to be tricky .	1
not all of the smaller roads names appeared on the map .	1
there were lots of lakes , state forests , and campgrounds .	1
there were other odd looking symbols on the map and missy was just about to ask her mom what they meant when her mom said , well , i have a general idea of where were going , and he does have a telephone , so we can call if we get lost .	1
he may live in the sticks but its not like someone in the area wouldnt know where big pine lodge was and who mr. stark is .	1
mr. stark ?	1
missy just realized that she hadnt even considered that her fathers grandfather would of course have the same last name , a name that had caused her a little bit of grief when some older boys had teased her and called her stork .	1
hey , stork , what long skinny legs you have .	1
hey , stork , deliver any babies recently ?	1
name-calling could be so mean .	1
what was , i mean , is , his first name ?	1
and what do i call him ?	1
great-grandpa ?	1
his name is john washington stark and i guess you can call him great-grandpa .	1
youll have to ask him .	1
i really cant tell you much more .	1
ive talked to him on the phone a couple of times .	1
he seemed nice , not a crotchety old geezer .	1
he said he especially wanted to give you something .	1
what ?	1
he didnt say .	1
hmm .	1
a mystery .	1
what would an almost hundred-year-old person have to give to a twelve year old girl he had never met ?	1
money ?	1
that would be good .	1
jewelry ?	1
maybe the lodge itself !	1
no , it was probably some dumb worthless heirloom like his wifes wedding ring .	1
sentimental value only .	1
missy sat staring out the car window trying to think of any other possibilities .	1
she was so completely lost in thought that she didnt even notice it had started to snow .	1
her mother laughed and said , i should have checked the weather report for up here .	1
we might need boots and warmer jackets .	1
missy came out of her trance and gasped , my gosh , i didnt know it would still be snowing in march !	1
its so pretty .	1
large fluffy flakes swirled down and started to cover the brownish-green shoulders of the expressway and the median between the north and southbound lanes .	1
no flakes stuck to the highway , though , they just seemed to dodge away from the tires of the cars in front of them , as if they were playing a flying game of tag .	1
missy was hypnotized by the sight and soon fell asleep , her head bobbing forward until her mother applied the brakes and slowed the car to exit .	1
ow , my neck hurts .	1
how long have i been sleeping ?	1
half an hour .	1
wow , there must be two inches of snow .	1
where are we ?	1
we are at the hard part .	1
spread the map on your lap so i can see it .	1
missy opened the map and found the exit number her mother had marked .	1
looks like you turn right here and we go about a half an inch to gunther road , missy said .	1
half an inch , huh ?	1
whats that , about two or three miles ?	1
no , the legend says one inch equals ten miles , so its about five miles from here .	1
they drove on slowly over the now white and slippery country roads .	1
they had no trouble finding gunther road or the next six turns but they both agreed that it was taking too long and they were hungry .	1
since they hadnt seen any other cars for the last ten minutes they simply stopped and ate their sandwiches in the car with the engine running .	1
the snow stopped and the sun came back out .	1
there was a sign on their right that they couldnt read before because it was covered with sticky , wet snow .	1
suddenly it all slid off and revealed a startling truth : welcome to starkville , population 125 .	1
starkville !	1
missy proclaimed .	1
mom , theres a town named after us !	1
after your ancestors , i guess .	1
i had no idea .	1
its too small to be printed on this map .	1
they looked at each other and laughed .	1
it was only five more miles but they missed the last turn and had to double back .	1
there was a sign at an unmarked lane that said , seasonal road , not plowed by road commission and they both agreed that this was most likely their last turn .	1
the car moved slowly down what seemed to be a disappearing road with heavy woods on either side .	1
they couldnt see very far ahead because the road would either dip or turn .	1
the snow clinging to the evergreens gave it a very picturesque and christmassy feel but missys mother seemed more than a little nervous about driving on the snow .	1
if another car came toward them there was nowhere to go but backwards .	1
missy , however , was thinking that she would like to come back in the summer and explore the woods .	1
look !	1
a fort !	1
at the side of the narrow road was an old wooden structure .	1
real logs had been set vertically into the ground and their tops had been cut into points .	1
there were small slit-like window openings on the two sides that could be seen from the road .	1
missy was enthralled with the crude structure .	1
it was about the size of a kids playhouse .	1
it would be a neat place to spy on visitors , she thought .	1
and just as that thought crossed her mind she noticed footprints in the snow at the far side of the fort .	1
she looked again at the small windows .	1
she couldnt see anyone there but she was sure that she felt someone looking back at her .	1
they made a sharp right then a sharp left turn and saw a large brown sign with green lettering : big pine lodge .	1
the sign was very rustic and yet seemed to missy to be promising something very special ahead .	1
one more turn through thick pine trees and the promise was revealed .	1
big pine lodge was enormous .	1
it was a dark brown log building three stories high .	1
it looked like paul bunyan had used giant lincoln logs to build it .	1
there was a huge porch across the entire front with two large porch swings to the right and the left of the double front doors .	1
the swings were gently swaying and the snow had blown little piles of downy drifts onto the seats .	1
the windows on the second and third floors were evenly spaced and the steeply pitched roof guaranteed an attic .	1
missy jumped out of the car and ran up the four wide steps to the lodges porch .	1
the front doors were larger than normal and carved with a scene of fish jumping out of a lake .	1
there was a large old-fashioned keyhole .	1
there was no knocker or doorbell so missy started pounding on the door .	1
she even jiggled the doorknob and tried to look through the keyhole but something was stuffed in the other side .	1
i dont think anyone is going to answer , missy , her mom said .	1
look .	1
missy turned to see her mother pointing off to the left .	1
now that she was on the porch she could see a dozen small cabins nestled in the pines at the side of the lodge .	1
it looked like the lodge had had twelve identical babies .	1
they were cute little mini-lodges , same style , same color .	1
each one had a stone chimney but only the first two had smoke , and , she now noticed , footprints .	1
her mother motioned for her to follow and said , he probably lives in the cabin during the winter and closes the lodge .	1
missy intently followed exactly in her mothers footprints in the snow but out of the corner of her eye she thought she saw a flash of red .	1
she stopped still and turned her head .	1
she only saw more pine trees and leafless oaks and maples .	1
it would be impossible to see very far into the woods when all the trees leafed out in the summer , she thought .	1
a person could really sneak around then .	1
but where would someone hide now ?	1
behind that fat pine ?	1
maybe .	1
her eyes followed the lines of the bark up the tree .	1
there were no lower branches to climb on but there was what looked like a platform on the strong upper branches high up .	1
another flash of red up there !	1
she was definitely being spied on .	1
missy ran to the base of the fat pine tree and circled it .	1
on the back side there were pieces of two by fours nailed at one foot intervals making a ladder up the old tree .	1
but from this side the platform above wasnt visible .	1
missy , come on !	1
her mother yelled .	1
missy crossed back over to her moms side , determined not to give the spy the satisfaction of a backward glance at the tree fort .	1
she kept her eyes straight ahead and was surprised to see that the lodge and all of the cabins were facing a beautiful little lake .	1
she could see a stone house on the far side but that was the only other residence on the lake .	1
they came around to the front of the cabin and knocked on the door .	1
they could hear a tv set go from loud to mute and then the door opened .	1
missy was half expecting an old santa claus or else a gruff old scrooge type but what she noticed first was a big grinning smile .	1
his teeth were white and probably false but the smile was so genuine and happy that she couldnt help but grin back at him .	1
you must be kimberly , he said to missys mother .	1
yes , im kim , mr. stark , and this is my daughter , your great-granddaughter , missy .	1
oh , call me john .	1
and you , little missy , you can call me great-grandpa .	1
or just great for short .	1
ha , ha , ha , ha !	1
his laugh was as infectious as his grin and missy liked him immediately .	1
his eyes , behind large glasses , were watery but friendly .	1
he had two hearing aids that were half hidden by a fringe of silver gray hair .	1
the top of his head was bald but he had a long gray beard and no mustache .	1
he had been a big man once but now he was a little bit stooped over .	1
such an old person should have a walker or at least a cane , but he moved away from the door and gestured them into the cabin quickly and smoothly .	1
they closed the door behind them and sat down on a green loveseat that was facing the fireplace .	1
the room was cozy but cramped .	1
besides the loveseat there was an old rocking chair , an easy chair , a tv , a computer desk and a hutch .	1
the room was open to the kitchen , which was just a wall with a stove , refrigerator , sink and a short counter .	1
a coffee pot , microwave , and toaster limited the workspace on the counter .	1
a small table and four wood chairs divided the kitchen and living room .	1
there was a door that led to the bathroom and bedroom but it was closed .	1
can i get you some coffee or hot chocolate ?	1
its already made .	1
i just have to stick it in the microwave .	1
he was already moving toward the kitchenette so they both agreed to hot chocolate .	1
they spent a half an hour getting acquainted and missy was actually thinking that this was fun and interesting .	1
she had learned that her great-grandfather and great-grandmother had built big pine lodge sixty years ago .	1
the original lodge was much smaller and had burned down many years ago but they had rebuilt it and added the cabins .	1
there was an owners apartment in the lodge that her great-grandfather used when the lodge was open , april to september , but he said that as soon as the weather turned cold he would always move into the first cabin for the winter .	1
he got very sad sounding when he spoke of her great-grandmother whom he referred to as the mrs. missy was curious to know what her name was and so she asked .	1
i called her missy , he said with a smile , but her real names a mystery .	1
he laughed that funny laugh of his again and missy laughed too .	1
she turned to her mom and asked , was i named after her ?	1
her mom looked puzzled and answered , maybe .	1
your dad and i had an agreement that i would get to name you if you were a boy and he would name you if you were a girl .	1
i always thought that maybe he had an old girlfriend by that name but i never asked .	1
old mr. stark just chuckled and said , another mystery .	1
we have lots of mysteries and secrets around here .	1
ill tell you a secret ill bet you never knew .	1
i knew your dad pretty well .	1
even though i havent spoken to my own son , your grandfather jacob , in forty years , his mother would bring him here when jacob went out of town on business .	1
sometimes they would stay for two weeks at a time but we would have to keep it a big secret .	1
it was hard to deceive jacob but your grandmother felt really strongly that your dad should know us .	1
now dont you go getting your grandmother into trouble by spilling the beans .	1
i never knew this , kim stark said .	1
missys dad sure was a loyal secret keeper .	1
yes , and when he was missys age he had a boxful of secrets , he laughed again and leaned forward in the easy chair , his beard nearly touching his lap .	1
he looked at missy and said , i want to talk to your mother a bit but you can go and explore the lodge if youd like .	1
ill get kevin to show you around .	1
without waiting for a reply or explaining who kevin was mr. stark eased out of the chair and opened the front door .	1
there was an old black triangle on a stand just outside the door and he took the metal gong rod and with a circular motion hit all three sides of the triangle a couple of times .	1
it was quite loud and echoed across the lake and back .	1
it wasnt ten seconds before a boy in a red jacket and jeans appeared at the door .	1
mr. stark introduced him as kevin jackson whose parents he employed as the lodges managers and general caretakers .	1
chapter 3 kevin , give missy the grand tour of the lodge , he said as he reached into his pocket and took out a large silver key .	1
it was on a chain with a penlight .	1
he handed it to kevin who nodded and turned to go out the door without waiting for missy .	1
she grabbed her coat and quickly followed .	1
kevin had stopped just outside the door and missy bumped into him .	1
im sorry , she said but he just smiled and started to walk toward the lodge .	1
he was slightly taller than missy and had dark brown curly hair .	1
hes either shy , stupid , or mute , missy thought .	1
she tried to think of something to say to start a conversation .	1
should she ask him if he was the one at the little fort spying at them ?	1
should she say something about the tree fort ?	1
no , no , instead she just asked , so , where do you live ?	1
we live past the last cabin , through the woods , and in back of the stables .	1
its a two-bedroom cottage .	1
weve lived there as long as i can remember .	1
my mom runs the lodge pretty much , handles the reservations , oversees the maids , the cooks , and the waitresses and my dad takes care of the grounds and maintenance stuff .	1
i work , too , he said proudly , i run the snack shack on the beach .	1
well , she thought , hes not shy , stupid , or mute .	1
he had rattled all that information off so fast that she had to think a minute before she could get her questions out .	1
they had reached the covered porch of the lodge but he was leading her around to a side door , much smaller and less ornate than the main entrance .	1
he turned the key in the lock and opened the door , then walked through first and flipped on the lights .	1
they were in a small entryway .	1
missy closed the door and said , wait , wait , slow down .	1
there are stables here ?	1
horses ?	1
not anymore .	1
but the stable used to have a dozen horses that the guests could rent .	1
at least thats what mr. stark told me .	1
the stable is empty now , just some old tack and stuff in there and junk .	1
and you said there were cooks and waitresses ?	1
yeah , theres a huge dining room for the guests to have breakfast , lunch and dinner in .	1
come on , ill show you .	1
he led the way down a short passageway that opened into a large restaurant style kitchen .	1
he turned on more lights that reflected off the stainless steel of the sinks , counters , and refrigerators .	1
they walked by several empty bins and then kevin pushed open the double swinging doors that led to a wonderful dining room .	1
there were four chandeliers made from deer antlers and several wall sconces but kevin didnt turn on any lights since there was plenty of light coming in through six large picture windows facing the lovely lake .	1
there were eight round tables with their chairs placed upside down on top .	1
missy walked over to the windows and looked out .	1
the lake was the central focus of the view but to the left there was a swing set and slide and to the right there was a small building with a sign that said snack shack .	1
thats where you work ?	1
yeah , kevin answered .	1
i sell soft drinks , candy , and ice cream in the afternoons .	1
mr. stark lets me keep all of the profits .	1
you cant tell now but all of that space there without trees is a really nice sand beach .	1
the guests love it , and this summer were going to hire a lifeguard .	1
missy was beginning to think that this would be a really great place to spend the summer , or at least two weeks , like her dad did .	1
come on , ill show you more .	1
kevin gave her a little tug on the sleeve and started toward the other end of the dining room .	1
there were two sets of french doors on either side of a two-sided stone fireplace .	1
they went through the doors on the left and entered another room the same size as the dining room .	1
it was a combination lobby/living room .	1
there was a counter for customers to check in at near the front doors .	1
there was one grouping of couches and chairs around the fireplace and another grouping around a big screen tv .	1
a wide staircase led to a landing and turned to continue on up .	1
off that way is the owners apartment that mr. stark lives in but my mom thinks hes going to let us live there this season .	1
down the other hall are the employees bedrooms , two to a room like a college dorm .	1
and check this out over here .	1
kevin walked straight to the bottom of the stairs and opened a small , three-foot high door to a small space under the stairs and landing .	1
a little light went on automatically , like opening the refrigerator , and there was a string to pull to switch on another brighter light bulb .	1
missy peered in .	1
it was full of pre-school toys , a tiny table , and two little chairs .	1
cute , she said .	1
it hides the rug-rats .	1
thats not all it hides , kevin said with a little smirk on his face .	1
you want to see the guests rooms ?	1
sure .	1
they backed out of the small space and kevin bounded up the doublewide staircase two steps at a time .	1
there was a large landing with a bench , a bookcase , and a brightly lit wall sconce and then the steps continued up to the second floor .	1
it was rather dark in the hallway with all of the rooms doors closed .	1
kevin went to the first door and pushed it open .	1
it was charming .	1
the carpet was a forest green but there were throw rugs with bright , colorful scenes .	1
the walls were paneled in light knotty pine .	1
the dresser was made of pine , too , and the drawers handles looked like small branches .	1
the two double beds were separated by a pine table with a deer antler lamp .	1
there were a table and two chairs near the windows which were framed by heavy green drapes .	1
behind the door on the left was a bathroom .	1
missy walked to the window and looked out .	1
she could see the little cabins , the lake , the snack shack , the stone cottage on the other side of the lake and something else off in the distance to the right .	1
whats that ?	1
she pointed .	1
good eye , kevin responded , its the closest thing we have to a mountain around here .	1
we call it mount rocky .	1
ive gone there climbing a bunch with my dad .	1
its pretty cool .	1
kevin looked shyly at her and said , maybe you could go with us when youre here for the summer .	1
missy was confused .	1
im not going to be here for the summer .	1
my mom works hard but i know we couldnt afford to stay here .	1
kevin had that smirk on his face like he knew something that she didnt know .	1
all he said was , well see .	1
he turned and headed for the door saying over his shoulder , the rest of the rooms on this floor are pretty much like this one but the third floor rooms are really nice .	1
she followed him again and this time she took the stairs to the third floor two at a time , too .	1
he didnt open the first room they came to but instead walked to the end of the hall and opened the second to the last door .	1
it was a two-room suite , much larger and brighter .	1
the ceiling seemed higher , too .	1
again missy went to the window and looked out .	1
now she could see the mountain better .	1
it would be so cool to stay here and explore , she thought .	1
kevin was pointing to the left .	1
see that trail past the last cabin ?	1
that leads to the stables and where i live .	1
oh , she paused , well , anything else to see here ?	1
whats behind that last door ?	1
it didnt seem like theres enough room there for another suite .	1
its a linen room .	1
.	1
.	1
and the way to the attic .	1
whats up there ?	1
ghosts .	1
missy rolled her eyes .	1
yeah , right .	1
you afraid ?	1
kevin wasnt about to be teased by a girl .	1
he reached for the knob but it wouldnt turn .	1
its locked .	1
so open it , youve got a key .	1
this was the key to the side door , it wont open the linen closet .	1
he jangled the silver key and penlight in front of her face .	1
how do you know if you dont try ?	1
she grabbed the key from his hand and stuck it roughly in the keyhole .	1
she wiggled it back and forth and pushed on the door .	1
it flew open .	1
she wasnt about to tell him that the door was still locked , it just hadnt been closed all the way .	1
there were shelves and shelves of sheets , blankets , towels , soap , and toilet paper .	1
looking up they could see that they would have a big problem getting into the attic .	1
there was no cord to pull on to lower the fold-down ladder .	1
they would need a pole with a hook on the end to catch the metal ring on the attic door .	1
darn , missy said , i really would have loved to explore an old attic .	1
well , kevin paused , if you really want to get in there , there is another way .	1
but its kind of scary .	1
he hesitated , and i dont know if i should show you .	1
its a secret mr. stark showed me .	1
my parents dont even know .	1
now missy really wanted to know .	1
she said , but im family .	1
he wouldnt mind .	1
well .	1
.	1
.	1
okay .	1
he laughed and challenged her to a race down the stairs .	1
she bounded after him but it was no contest when he leaped onto the banister and slid to the first landing .	1
hey , no fair !	1
she hollered .	1
she hopped onto the banister and slid , much more slowly , after him .	1
when they reached the lobby/living room he went back to the little room under the stairs .	1
in here .	1
he lifted a poster of snoopy and revealed a narrow door .	1
it was latched at the top where a toddler couldnt reach , but kevin easily unhooked it .	1
this is where the penlight comes in handy .	1
he switched it on and started up a steep circular metal stairway .	1
it was like a long firehouse pole with narrow steel steps bolted to it .	1
there was no railing and missy went up only three steps before she started grabbing the next steps with her hands and sort of crab-crawled upwards .	1
after a few more feet she looked up at kevin who had stopped and was looking straight down on her between the steps .	1
scary , huh ?	1
he smirked .	1
the light from below didnt reach much past his head and she couldnt see the top but there were two pinpricks of light coming through the wall about one-third and two-thirds of the way up .	1
she wasnt sure if she went up she would be able to get back down .	1
she thought she would have to come back backwards on her hands and knees , as there was no way she could walk forward and twist and turn around the pole .	1
yeah , this is pretty scary , she confessed .	1
i dont know if i want to do this anymore .	1
kevin switched on the penlight and shined it at the wall .	1
see that hole ?	1
that light is coming in where the lamp on the wall is at the first landing .	1
you can spy on people , listen to them , see what theyre reading .	1
its kind of fun .	1
come on .	1
missy wasnt tempted .	1
maybe if there had been someone to spy on she would have found the courage but she just plain felt scared .	1
her mother had drilled into that if she didnt feel right about something , she shouldnt do it .	1
trust yourself , her mom would say , people have instincts just like animals .	1
i dont think so , was all that missy said .	1
luckily kevin wasnt the sort of kid who would bully someone and he seemed to understand her fear .	1
okay , you go back and take the stairs .	1
ill go up this way and open the trap door ladder from the attic .	1
missy inched her way backwards and managed to turn herself around for the last few steps .	1
she ran up the first flight and a half and stopped at the second landing to see if she could find where the light was coming through .	1
kevin !	1
she yelled .	1
can you hear me ?	1
she knocked on the wall .	1
his muffled voice came back , yeah , look through the hole under the bottom screw on the light .	1
she put her face up to the wall and pressed her right cheek to the metal .	1
it was dark and she couldnt see a thing through the wall when suddenly kevin shined the penlight directly into her pupil .	1
she jumped back .	1
hey !	1
she could hear kevin laughing on the other side .	1
on the third floor she went to the end of the hall where they had left the door to the linen room open .	1
she could hear his footsteps above her and then the attic door swung open and the ladder came down .	1
it was a lot easier to climb than the spiral stairs and she scampered up them easily .	1
kevin had moved to the side and was reaching for a string that turned on a light bulb overhead .	1
then he walked past her to the other side and turned on another one .	1
a small amount of light was coming in through some vents .	1
this is a good time to explore , he said , because its about a hundred degrees up here in the summer .	1
show me where you came up the hidden staircase , missy said .	1
he led her over to the front middle of the large expanse and pointed the penlight at a trap door in the floor .	1
there was no handle , just a knothole in the wood that served as a finger hold to lift the door .	1
i can see why its a secret , she said .	1
its practically invisible .	1
missy turned and looked around the attic .	1
she saw a lot of big boxes , two trunks , a crib , four mattresses , and some old furniture .	1
near the far wall the floor and several shelves were littered with odd-looking mechanical things , some quite large .	1
the trunks looked the most interesting , however .	1
one was gray with a big keyhole but it wasnt locked .	1
inside she found a fur coat .	1
genuine muskrat , the tag said .	1
this is cool , she said .	1
she put the coat on and knelt back down at the trunk .	1
there was a packet of papers tied with a string , a small metal box full of medals , an old photo album and some yellowed newspapers .	1
she thumbed through the album and put it back .	1
one newspaper was dated thirty years ago but she didnt check the other ones .	1
she put everything back except the muskrat coat and turned her attention to the other trunk .	1
kevin had already opened it and was taking things out ; a dress , two hats , some strange looking pants .	1
ooooo , missy said , i know what those are .	1
those are old-fashioned riding pants .	1
theyre kind of puffed out at the sides and tight below the knees .	1
must be from when they had the stables filled with horses .	1
they rode english style not western .	1
there were more articles of clothing in the trunk and at the bottom they found nicely framed pictures of people .	1
some were in color but most of them were in black and white .	1
they didnt recognize anyone in the pictures but missy suspected that the tall gentleman with the black beard was probably her great-grandfather , which would mean that the lady next to him was her great-grandmother .	1
she was very pretty and mysterious looking .	1
they put everything back and closed the trunks lid .	1
missy was thinking that this weekend had turned out pretty fun after all .	1
she liked kevin and he seemed to be easy to get along with even though a few times he acted like he knew more than she did .	1
she smiled to herself and ran her hands up and down the arms of the fur coat .	1
it was so soft .	1
there were big pockets on the sides and she reached her fingers into them .	1
she could feel the silk lining in each but the left one had a small tear in the seam .	1
she slipped her arms out of the coat and took it off .	1
she folded it in half like it had been and put it back in the first trunk .	1
as she patted it down to fit into the trunk she felt something hard in the hem .	1
she pressed the object between her fingers trying to determine what it was .	1
hey , kevin , she called , come here .	1
kevin got up from the floor where he was looking through a box marked comic books .	1
feel this , missy said and held up the bottom of the coat .	1
feels like a key .	1
i think it was in the pocket and slipped through a hole .	1
i wonder what it opens .	1
she had already reached one hand into the pocket and was working the key towards it with the other hand .	1
there !	1
i got it !	1
she pulled out a most strange looking key .	1
just then they could hear that clanging sound made by the triangle on mr. starks porch .	1
oh , oh , kevin said , wed better get back .	1
he ran over to the lights and pulled the strings to turn them off .	1
missy went down the attic ladder first .	1
when kevin reached the bottom he gave the ladder a push and the whole thing sprang back up .	1
it banged loudly .	1
oh , well , kevin said , no big deal .	1
when they got back to the cabin they were red-faced and panting .	1
kevin kept on trotting past the cabin and yelled , bye !	1
see you this summer !	1
missy didnt know what to say so she just waved and said , see ya .	1
she still held the strange key in her hand when she entered the cabin .	1
mom , wait till you see the lodge .	1
it is awesome .	1
she removed her shoes and jacket and held out her hand to reveal the odd key .	1
look what we found in an old fur coat in the attic .	1
her great-grandfather grinned .	1
finders keepers , he said .	1
maybe youll want to keep that in this treasure box .	1
it was your fathers when he was a boy .	1
he was holding out a wooden puzzle box about the size of a large shoebox .	1
missy reached out her hands and took the box .	1
may i keep it ?	1
she asked .	1
of course , he answered .	1
but ive got to warn you , ive forgotten how to open it .	1
your dad and i made that together a long time ago .	1
i have no idea what treasures or secrets he had in there .	1
you have to move the pieces in just the right sequence or it wont open .	1
good luck .	1
missy was intrigued .	1
she wanted to start working on the mystery immediately but her mother was saying something about getting their bag out of the car and settling in to the second cabin .	1
they were going to spend the night .	1
thank you so much , great-grandpa .	1
and i really like your lodge .	1
this is a cool place but dont you get lonely in the winter ?	1
he chuckled .	1
i dont have time .	1
im always busy making something , tinkering with something , inventing something .	1
.	1
.	1
making more secrets and mysteries .	1
he laughed again .	1
and ive really gotten attached to that computer there , too .	1
pretty good for an old man , huh ?	1
yeah , missy agreed , i didnt think hundred year old people used computers .	1
missys mothers face looked stricken and the old man seemed not able to suck in any air .	1
then suddenly he laughed the most uproarious laugh of all .	1
is that how old you think i am ?	1
maybe i should shave this beard and stick it on top of my head !	1
ive got more than a dozen years before i see one hundred .	1
but thats okay .	1
did kevin tell you to say that ?	1
he was still laughing but missy was embarrassed .	1
she didnt mean to offend him .	1
well , at least he didnt seem offended but she couldnt get an apology out of her mouth or even a word in defense of kevin .	1
her mother rescued her by blaming the misunderstanding on something she had heard about how old the lodge was .	1
she managed to turn the whole thing into a compliment about how he must have been a really smart businessman at an early age to have been able to afford to build the lodge .	1
actually that wasnt so far from the truth .	1
apparently he had been , and maybe still was , a gifted inventor .	1
something he had patented as a young man was still bringing in money .	1
they stayed that night in the second little cabin and had a nice breakfast with mr. stark on sunday morning .	1
she didnt see kevin again but shyly asked her great-grandfather a few questions about him .	1
oh , ill just let him answer your questions when you come back in june , he said .	1
missy looked quickly at her mother who was smiling and nodding her head .	1
you can stay a week , two weeks , the whole summer if you want , her mom was saying .	1
its up to you .	1
your great-grandfather and i discussed this yesterday .	1
but you have to work in the kitchen some mornings and help the maids , too .	1
what do you think ?	1
would you like to spend the summer at big pine lodge ?	1
youll stay in one of the maids rooms , her great-grandfather added .	1
are you coming , too , mom ?	1
she asked .	1
weekends and one week in august .	1
great !	1
missy hooted .	1
great !	1
this will be really fun .	1
chapter 4 the rest of the school year went quickly for missy .	1
she wore the strange key on a silver chain around her neck as if it were a pendant .	1
she worked on trying to open the puzzle box everyday after her homework was done .	1
after three weeks of getting nowhere with it she went to the public library and started researching puzzle boxes .	1
she found a book on antiques that showed many beautiful examples but no clues on how to open them .	1
the head media specialist helped her search the internet and they found a site that offered a book of instructions on how to construct your own .	1
the specialist was so intrigued that she ordered a copy for the library and put a hold on it in missys name .	1
missy had to wait impatiently another three weeks before it came in .	1
it was a warm day in early may and missy had unsuccessfully compared almost all of the construction plans to her fathers box when she came upon one that seemed similar .	1
she looked at the end product and worked backwards through the assembly to visualize the sequence to open the box .	1
she took out a notebook and wrote down the steps as she moved and turned and twisted and lifted the individual pieces .	1
slowly the box seemed to be opening and she had a dozen pieces spread out on her bedroom floor , but the final piece would not slide or budge .	1
she sat staring at it until it occurred to her that if her crafty great-grandfather had been an inventor he probably would have made this box to be unique .	1
the last piece wouldnt slide or turn or twist or lift off so she did exactly what you wouldnt expect : she pushed the piece in hard .	1
wow , she thought , i got it !	1
pushing in the last piece triggered a tiny mechanism to release a hinge on the side of the box .	1
it literally fell open like the trapdoor leading to the lodges attic .	1
she poured the treasured objects out onto the carpet .	1
her father had thought that these items were precious enough to hide away in a box almost impossible to open and this was a moment that she could feel really connected to him .	1
there were seven things .	1
first there was an old photo of a girl about thirteen or fourteen .	1
it was a school picture and on the back was written ill never forget how scared we were in the caves !	1
see you next summer , mary .	1
this was interesting .	1
it was hard to think of her parents ever being her age , having friends , even being scared .	1
she wondered if her dad had liked mary in a special way and if they had seen each other the next summer .	1
the next item answered that question .	1
it was an old newspaper clipping about a drowning .	1
the victims name was mary gowen and the picture of her was the same school photo .	1
how sad !	1
her father must have felt really bad .	1
the article said that her body was never recovered .	1
the next four items in the puzzle box seemed sentimental : a badminton birdie , a broken wishbone , a perfectly round skipping stone , and a tiny silver hat from a monopoly game .	1
the last thing was a swiss army knife full of all sorts of gadgets .	1
she had never held one in her hand before though she had seen her uncle use one to help open packages at christmas .	1
she turned the knife over and over in her hands and pulled out all the little tools one by one .	1
she couldnt identify a few of the thingamajigs but she thought that she could ask her great-grandfather all about the knife and about the girl who drowned when she spent the summer at the lodge .	1
it was still a month away but missy was getting more excited with every passing day .	1
she carefully returned all of the articles to the puzzle box and closed the side hatch .	1
she followed the directions she had written out to put the box back together .	1
every day she practiced opening and closing the box until she could do it without the instructions and do it fast .	1
on the night before the drive up to big pine lodge she took the key from the chain around her neck and added it to the treasures in the puzzle box .	1
she hardly slept a wink that night .	1
chapter 5 the long drive up to the lodge seemed to be shorter this time as missy and her mom chatted nonstop .	1
they would both miss the other a lot and they were doing all of their summer talks at once .	1
missy poured her heart out about the school year that had just ended and her mother gave her the appropriate sympathies .	1
missy hadnt shared the knowledge of the contents of her fathers treasure box with her mom yet so while her moms eyes were fixed on the highway she opened it .	1
she read the newspaper clipping aloud and her mom glanced over at the photo of mary .	1
her husband had never told her anything about the lodge so she wasnt surprised that hed never spoken of this friend .	1
she laughed when she saw the other items and told missy that when they were dating they used to play monopoly and he had always insisted on being the hat .	1
they both were silent for a while as each wished that she could talk with him now .	1
missy put everything back into the box and closed it up just as they exited the highway .	1
the scenery was certainly different from that snowy day in march .	1
when they saw the starkville sign they knew they werent far .	1
there was a new sign at the last turn announcing big pine lodge , open may to september , turn here .	1
the road seemed even narrower than it did before since all the ferns along the side leaned into the lane as if they wanted to touch every visitors car .	1
mrs. stark was nervous again about meeting up with another car but missy was in awe of the surrounding forest .	1
the pine trees that had been so prominent in march were less visible now that the maple and oak trees had completely leafed out .	1
as they passed the fort it was half obscured by the two-foot high ferns .	1
missy rolled down her window and breathed in the warm mid-june air .	1
there was a distinct aroma to the woods that was very appealing and the songs of the birds were amazing .	1
one in particular sounded so haunting that she thought it was warning her off .	1
just then her mother stepped hard on the brakes .	1
three deer darted across the lane and disappeared instantly in the thick woods .	1
wow .	1
that was close .	1
and i was worried about hitting another car , her mom said .	1
they drove up to the front of the lodge and parked .	1
kevin was on a porch swing waiting and immediately jumped up and waved .	1
he scampered down the steps and greeted them with a grin , hi !	1
come on .	1
ill take you to your great-grandfather .	1
he hasnt been feeling well .	1
ill show you your room .	1
youre going to love it here .	1
wait til you see what we made .	1
he had so much to say he rattled it out faster than they could hear it all .	1
hi , kevin .	1
whats wrong with mr. stark ?	1
missys mom asked hi , kevin .	1
whatd you make ?	1
missy asked at the same time .	1
kevin slowed down and answered mrs. stark first .	1
hes been having some trouble breathing but the doctor said not to worry , it was the stress of opening for another season .	1
hes in the dining room now .	1
he looked at missy and said , you wont believe it .	1
mr. stark helped me make an elevator for the tree house .	1
and its invisible so you have to know the secret to work it .	1
sounds cool , missy smiled .	1
kevin helped them with their bags and led them first to missys room .	1
it was in the servants wing on the first floor .	1
youre sharing with angela , kevin said , pushing the door open .	1
she left it unlocked for you .	1
shes finishing up in the kitchen now .	1
they set the bags on the second twin bed and said , youll like angela .	1
she just finished her freshman year at college and shes the nicest one of the five maids .	1
but youll like them all .	1
theres danielle , lindsay , courtney , and alicia .	1
they wait tables , clean rooms , and make beds .	1
they rotate chores .	1
theres a schedule right there .	1
he pointed to a paper on the nightstand .	1
they all have the afternoons off until 5 oclock when they help with the buffet .	1
so youll be able to meet them in a little while .	1
missy picked up the schedule .	1
her name was on it , too , but her duties ended before noon .	1
it didnt look too hard and she felt good about earning her keep : free meals and room and freedom for the summer .	1
it occurred to her at that moment that she was going to be as independent as one of these college girls .	1
her mother must have been reading her mind .	1
you still have a bedtime , missy .	1
ive already talked to mrs. jackson , kevins mom , on the phone and you are to check in with her throughout the day .	1
okay ?	1
without waiting for an answer mrs. stark looked at kevin and asked when they could meet his mother .	1
kevin jumped off the end of the wooden footboard of the twin bed he had been perched on and motioned for them to follow him .	1
shes probably going over receipts with your great-grandfather .	1
theyre in the dining room .	1
they followed him down the hallway and through the lovely reception area/ living room .	1
mrs. stark hadnt seen it before and slowed her pace down to take in the detail of the quaint lodge .	1
they entered the dining room where there were still a few people finishing up lunch .	1
at the table nearest the kitchen sat mrs. jackson and john stark .	1
mrs. jackson was a nice-looking lady with medium length brown hair .	1
she was wearing khaki pants , a red shirt with the name of the lodge on the front , and a belt that held a beeper , a phone , and a huge ring of keys .	1
she had the same smile as kevin and stood up to greet them .	1
after the introductions were completed they all sat around the table and chatted for a while .	1
missy thought that her great-grandfather looked paler but he acted the same as before .	1
his beard was trimmed up quite a bit , though .	1
he seemed as excited as kevin to show her the tree fort elevator so the three of them left the two mothers and went outside .	1
youre not going to believe this , said kevin .	1
he and missy had run ahead of mr. stark and were at the base of the tree .	1
missy walked around and around the tree .	1
she could see the platform high above and the steps on the one side .	1
the steps had rope coming down along each side , but where was the elevator ?	1
all right , she said , i give up .	1
whats the joke ?	1
mr. stark joined them and was coughing a little bit but smiling .	1
show her , kevin .	1
kevin pointed to the bark at the bottom of the tree .	1
look really close .	1
missy knelt down in the thin grass and got close to the ground .	1
now she could see that the bark appeared fake .	1
she reached her left hand out and felt up and down the bark of the tree .	1
she could feel a difference .	1
stumped ?	1
kevin asked .	1
ha !	1
mr. stark laughed .	1
kevin you made a joke !	1
yeah , im stumped .	1
whats the trick ?	1
i can feel a difference , though , missy said .	1
mr. stark steadied himself on the tree trunk while kevin pressed two spots on the left of where missys hand had been and two spots on the right .	1
suddenly a one foot by two foot section of false bark popped free of the tree and the ropes along the steps swung out .	1
kevin stepped onto the tiny platform and held the ropes .	1
the elevator started to ascend .	1
missy , open-mouthed , stared upward , this is so cool !	1
kevin reached the top and called down , your great-grandfather knows everything about pulleys and weights and levers and mechanisms .	1
this project only took us two weeks this spring .	1
he was on his way back down now and missy was eager to try it out .	1
you better sit on it like a swing the first time , legs out away from the tree .	1
missy rode it several times sitting down and then dared to go up standing , facing the tree .	1
that way she could step out onto the fort above and check it out , too .	1
she felt just a little dizzy but swallowed hard and took a deep breath .	1
the view from the fort wasnt what she expected .	1
there were so many leaves that she couldnt see much , but then no one could see her either .	1
she realized that it was really pretty nice of kevin to share this place with her .	1
maybe he didnt have any more friends than she did .	1
she heard them laughing below and then the sound of her great-grandfather coughing .	1
the coughing seemed to get fainter and fainter as if he were heading back to the lodge .	1
suddenly kevin appeared .	1
he had climbed up the steps .	1
oh , you startled me , missy said .	1
sorry , but you didnt send the elevator back .	1
im thinking we should get rid of the steps so no one can sneak up .	1
what do you think ?	1
missy was pleased that he was asking for her opinion .	1
they sat up there and talked about forts and spying , her duties , his snack shop job , school , parents , and just about anything that came to mind .	1
missy learned a lot more about her great-grandfather and the lodge .	1
the stark land , woods , lodge , lake and all , covered two square miles .	1
she started to ask about swimming and boating in the lake when kevin got a funny look on his face and said , oh , oh , ive got to open the snack shack !	1
he helped her into the elevator then took the steps .	1
he showed her how to press the bark platform back into its hiding place then waved as he hurried around the lodge to the beach .	1
missy smiled to herself and then looked all around at the beautiful surroundings .	1
when she looked up at the lodge she saw a face in one of the windows looking down at her .	1
he was maybe a high school boy , fifteen , sixteen .	1
his hair was longish and he didnt look pleasant .	1
he was squinting at her from the third floor and she felt very uncomfortable .	1
had he seen the elevator ?	1
you have finished the first 5 chapters of the secret in the hidden cave .	1
this book is available in paperback and online in digital e-book format .	1
it is the first in big pine lodge series and is followed by mysterys grave and bullies and bears .	1
next up is a sampling of the first 5 chapters from bullies and bears .	1
bullies and bears chapter 1 at the side of the narrow road leading in to big pine lodge was an old wooden structure .	1
real logs had been set vertically into the ground and their tops had been cut into points .	1
there were small slit-like window openings on the two sides that could be seen from the road .	1
missy was enthralled with the crude structure .	1
it was about the size of a kids playhouse .	1
it would be a neat place to spy on visitors , she had thought the first time she had driven by with her mother last march .	1
there had been snow on the ground then and she had seen kevins tracks .	1
he had turned out to be a good friend to her when she had moved up to big pine lodge in june , but he had been spying on her back then .	1
right now she and kevin were settling into the little fort with a picnic lunch of sandwiches , cheese , and bottled water .	1
kevin had warned her that the guests arriving for the fourth of july week included a bunch of teenage boys that werent exactly nice and they were watching for their arrival from the fort .	1
missys great-grandfather owned big pine lodge .	1
it was a quaint resort on a small lake and boasted a large lodge , several smaller cabins and lots of fun things to do .	1
there were caves that ran under the lake , old indian graves and settlers ruins , and , to missys great delight , a stable of horses that she was in charge of .	1
kevins parents ran the lodge as employees of mr. starks and kevin earned spending money by selling snacks and drinks on the beach .	1
the two twelve-year-olds had already this summer been involved in two adventures .	1
first they had discovered ancient pictographs in the caves and found hidden entrances to the caves themselves .	1
later they had helped capture wild bobcats that were scaring the lodges guests .	1
missy had made several friends this summer , but after a week or two their vacations were over and they would go back to their homes .	1
missy was glad she got along so well with kevin or she would have been very lonely staying with just her great-grandfather .	1
her mother was back in the city working and would visit occasionally .	1
missys dad had died when she was four , but he had grown up coming here .	1
for missy , working here in the summer was a way for her to kind of get to know him .	1
she had already learned a lot about him from a diary her great-grandmother had left as well as a secret puzzle box that her father had used to hide things that were special to him .	1
hey , kevin said , can i borrow your swiss army knife a second ?	1
missy pulled it out of her pocket and handed it over .	1
it was the most useful thing that her dad had left in the secret puzzle box .	1
the other items had been more sentimental : a school picture of a friend , a newspaper article , a round skipping stone , a badminton birdie , a broken wishbone and a tiny silver hat from a monopoly game .	1
she had taken the items out often and thought about her dad .	1
it was weird to think of him being her age , but it was an interesting change to just knowing him through her moms wedding photos .	1
kevin used one of the gadgets on the knife to pry off the plastic seal on his bottle then passed it back to missy .	1
this fort would be really cool if it had a roof , missy said as she unwrapped her sandwich .	1
my dad uses it in the fall as a deer blind .	1
he got a six point buck last year , kevin said .	1
missy was a little upset to think that people could shoot those beautiful animals , but kevin seemed proud and added , next year im taking a hunter safety class so i can hunt , too .	1
missy just nodded and kept her feelings to herself .	1
she took a big bite so she wouldnt have to answer and swiveled on her pine stump perch to glance out one of the little spying windows .	1
a car was coming .	1
they could hear the crunch of gravel as it turned onto the little lane that led to the lodge .	1
a second crunch indicated that another vehicle was following the first .	1
kevin pulled up two large ferns and thrust one at missy .	1
they held the ferns in front of their faces as camouflage as they peered out at the passing cars .	1
the first one held two sets of parents , none of whom even glanced at the fort .	1
the second car bounced along with its windows open and four boys laughing and cursing inside .	1
the one in the front passenger seat pointed at the fort and from the back seat another boy stuck first his head out the window and then his hand .	1
he flicked the butt of a cigarette toward the fort and yelled , we see you !	1
missy ducked down and dropped the fern , but kevin stayed steady .	1
the car rambled on and the noise of the boisterous teens faded .	1
kevin scolded missy , you shouldnt have moved , missy , they couldnt see us .	1
they were just guessing that id be here .	1
they yelled that last year , but i was in the tree on the other side of the road .	1
theyre such jerks .	1
rob had his license last summer and now it looks like dave does , too .	1
dave was the one driving ?	1
missy asked .	1
i couldnt see him .	1
who was the one who threw out the cigarette ?	1
that was lonnie .	1
hes not too bad , but his brother dave is mean .	1
and the other two brothers , rob and rick , are just plain weird .	1
i dont trust them .	1
theyll do whatever dave tells them to do .	1
like what ?	1
like the first summer both families came up together they tied me to a tree and piled up campfire wood around me .	1
they would have lit it , too , but dave had kept the matches in his pocket and had gone swimming earlier so they were too wet to light .	1
what did your parents do when they found out ?	1
i didnt tell them because dave said hed get me if i did .	1
missy thought about that for a minute and glanced back out the little window toward the road .	1
oh , no !	1
she screamed .	1
she leaped up and grabbed kevins open water bottle and ran out the back of the fort .	1
she skirted around it and stopped where the cigarette had landed and started pouring the water on the small fire that had started in the dry leaves .	1
that was close !	1
she exclaimed as kevin reached her .	1
they both stomped around on the ground until they were sure there werent any sparks left that would start another fire .	1
man , that would have been a disaster , kevin said , brushing back a lock of his curly brown hair that had fallen in his eyes .	1
were going to have to watch those jerks all the time .	1
no telling what theyll do .	1
lets be sneaky about it , missy said , i dont want to get tied up and burned .	1
right .	1
the adults were unloading the luggage from the trunks of both cars while the four boys , dave and rob in the lead , headed around the lodge to the beach .	1
no way were they going to help by carrying stuff in .	1
they got out of earshot as fast as they could .	1
dave pointed at a couple of girls on the beach and made a rude comment about one to rob who laughed loudly .	1
lonnie and ricky pushed past them and ran for the canoes .	1
i dont think so , little brothers , dave yelled .	1
he punched rob on the arm .	1
come on .	1
lets beat them .	1
the older boys quickly outpaced the younger ones and reached the pair of canoes first .	1
they shoved one canoe out then jumped into the second one and started paddling .	1
as they came along side the first canoe dave reached out and tipped it over with the paddle .	1
they laughed as they watched it fill with water and sink .	1
hey , im telling dad youre not wearing life jackets , lonnie hollered .	1
his older brother , dave , just looked back and raised up one finger .	1
jerk , lonnie muttered .	1
ricky had already removed his socks and shoes and told lonnie to do the same .	1
come on , he said , we can still get the canoe .	1
its not deep there .	1
from the back porch of the lodge old mr. stark stood shaking his head .	1
he dreaded seeing these two families return to the lodge each year .	1
the boys were nothing but trouble and the parents were loud partiers and never disciplined their sons .	1
already he could see people near the shore picking up their beach towels and relocating to a quieter spot .	1
kevins parents , the jacksons , would have to smooth things over with the other guests when the complaints started coming in .	1
if things didnt improve this year he would just have to double the rates for them , though getting twice as much money might not be worth it .	1
hi , great-grandpa , missy said as she and kevin came around the lodge .	1
hi , mr. stark , kevin added , then stopped to stare out at the boys in the canoes .	1
hey , theyre not wearing life preservers .	1
should i go get dad ?	1
old mr. stark made a grunt-like sound then said , dont bother , kevin , ill go say something to their parents .	1
he reached out and touched missys shoulder affectionately and smiled at her as he turned toward the door .	1
then he muttered , not that itll do any good with those rapscallions .	1
after the door closed kevin asked missy , whats a rapscallion ?	1
she just shrugged her shoulders .	1
guess its something bad .	1
out on the lake ricky was holding onto the canoe , which was now floating upright , while lonnie was retrieving the paddles from the shoreline .	1
the older boys were almost halfway across the small lake heading straight for the little stone cottage on the other side .	1
lonnie and daves mother , mrs. gilbert , came out of the lodge holding four life vests and shouting in a shrill voice , you boys get back here and put these life jackets on !	1
the younger boys protested that they could swim just fine and didnt need them .	1
rules are rules , now you behave .	1
put these on and take the other two out to your brothers .	1
lonnie and ricky looked at each other and mumbled something that kevin and missy , who were watching intently , couldnt hear .	1
mrs. gilbert hurried toward the lake and hollered to the older boys out on the water .	1
we cant hear you !	1
they hollered back and kept paddling .	1
she shouted louder and they just kept paddling away .	1
kevin rolled his eyes at missy and said , man , would i be in trouble if i lied to my parents like that .	1
me , too .	1
the younger boys pulled the canoe onto the beach and dropped the paddles .	1
were gon na check out the trails , mom .	1
see ya , lonnie said and he and ricky slipped their shoes and socks back on and raced off towards the woods .	1
mrs. gilbert just stood there for a moment debating whether or not to keep yelling at the older boys .	1
finally she turned around and carried the jackets back to the lodge .	1
what do you think theyll do in the woods ?	1
missy asked kevin .	1
i dont know , but im more worried about dave and rob .	1
theyre headed for the stone cottage and the entrance to the caves .	1
theyre such jerks that theyd probably love to ruin the ancient drawings that are down there , once they find out about them .	1
kevin glanced toward the trail along the beach .	1
i bet i know where the younger brothers are going .	1
if they run they can beat the canoes to the other side .	1
come on , lets go follow them .	1
without a seconds hesitation missy took off after kevin .	1
the hard-packed earth on the trail was easy to run on as long as they didnt trip on any of the roots or rocks that littered the path .	1
they slowed down every time the trail took a sharp turn , but otherwise they kept a pretty fast pace with kevin in the lead .	1
there were several other trails that forked off and led to various destinations such as the indian graves and the old settlers ruins , but they kept taking the left fork , staying close to the lake .	1
tell me again which one is which ?	1
missy said .	1
kevin took a moment to think of the best way to describe them then told her that she could remember easiest by linking the first letter of their names to a feature .	1
dave was dark .	1
he had dark hair and eyes and a dark personality .	1
his brother lonnie was little .	1
he was the shortest of the four .	1
his hair was more of reddish brown and he actually looked like he belonged in rob and rickys family instead .	1
rob and ricky had the same first initial and were both red-heads , but ricky , the younger brother had freckles and was still a little pudgy .	1
okay , missy said , i think ive got them straight .	1
they almost caught up to lonnie and ricky when the trail opened up to the yard around the stone cottage .	1
kevin slowed down before they reached the open area and he and missy ducked down behind a big boulder that was wedged between two large oak trees .	1
they could see the seventeen-year-olds just reaching the shore in the canoe while the fifteen-year-olds were standing at the door to the cottage yelling at their older brothers .	1
man , are you slow !	1
lonnie shouted .	1
yeah , you row like girls , ricky added .	1
you row a boat .	1
you paddle a canoe , you a-holes .	1
dave yelled .	1
yeah , youre the little girls here , you morons .	1
just wait till we get you !	1
rob added .	1
he and dave tossed the paddles on the shore after they beached the canoe and started racing to the cottage .	1
lonnie and ricky ducked inside and ricky opened the trap door to the cellar , but lonnie grabbed rickys sleeve and pulled him away from the opening .	1
he motioned for him to follow him and they slipped around the corner and hid in what was once a small bedroom .	1
they were quiet and motionless when they heard their brothers barge into the front room and scramble down the ladder into the cellar and the access to the caves .	1
lonnie looked at ricky and whispered , lets put something heavy on the trap door so they cant get out .	1
what if somebody else is down there ?	1
so ?	1
is there another way out ?	1
who cares ?	1
somebodyll come along sooner or later .	1
shhh .	1
wait .	1
i think i heard something .	1
missy and kevin creaked the front door open and tiptoed into the cottage .	1
they were whispering , too .	1
kevin checked the box of flashlights that they kept there and counted how many were left .	1
theyre all here , he whispered .	1
they didnt know about the flashlights .	1
theyll probably use their cigarette lighters or one of the candles that are in the cellar .	1
he handed missy a small flashlight and she tucked it into her back pocket .	1
i dont think i want to go down there , she said .	1
im not scared .	1
i just dont think its a good idea .	1
kevin picked up a large flashlight and was about to whisper back when ricky and lonnie stepped around the corner .	1
well , well , well , lonnie said , if it isnt little mr. jackson , son of big mr. jackson .	1
look , ricky , the little snot-nosed kid got himself a girlfriend .	1
down the hatch , you two , ricky said , gesturing toward the trap door .	1
lonnie reached out and grabbed the flashlight out of kevins hand then pushed him toward the opening .	1
ladies first , he said , still pushing kevin ahead of missy .	1
missy followed , but was able to keep facing them so they couldnt see the flashlight in her back pocket .	1
she said nothing as she climbed down .	1
she didnt even dare to look them in the eye though she was mad and scared and her heart was fluttering faster than a hummingbirds wings .	1
when she reached the bottom she backed away from the ladder and bumped into kevin just as the trap door was closed above them and they were thrust into darkness .	1
chapter 2 a large black bear waded across a shallow stream a mile northeast of big pine lodge .	1
two cute and playful cubs followed her into the water , snapping at each other and biting at the water as well .	1
the mother bear never checked to see if her babies were following her .	1
maybe she knew from their sounds or their scent or maybe she just knew because they hadnt been more than a hundred feet away from her since they came out of hibernation four months ago .	1
she had traveled farther from her cave than ever before in her quest for more and more food .	1
something was drawing her southwest , perhaps a whiff of wild blueberries reaching the end of their ripening in this warm july weather .	1
or perhaps she could smell the rotting fish guts that mr. jackson regularly threw out for the raccoons after he cleaned fish caught by the lodges guests .	1
whatever the reason , the mother bear was slowly and surely heading for big pine lodge as if she were a regular guest with a standing reservation .	1
missy and kevin stood like statues listening to the two jerks above them struggle to drag a rusty old wood stove over the trap door .	1
ricky and lonnie laughed loudly and made a point of stomping out of the cottage and slamming the door .	1
they laughed their way to the shore where they picked up the paddles and helped themselves to the canoe .	1
they took their time returning to the lodge , paddling slowly along the shore instead of cutting across the lake , glancing back at the stone cottage from time to time and laughing their heads off .	1
theyre gone , kevin said , but their stupid brothers are down here .	1
now that our eyes have adjusted to the dark maybe we can see the glow of their lighters and know which tunnel they took .	1
missy nodded though kevin could not see that , then she whispered , i still have the little flashlight .	1
we can take the tunnels under the lake and come up through the trapdoor in the lodges playroom .	1
they had discovered this entrance the first week of the summer .	1
though kevin had shown missy the secret staircase to the attic , it was missy who had found a strange key in the attic .	1
that key had opened the playrooms hidden trap door down to the caves .	1
the cave tunnels ran like a maze under the lodge and the lake and the high hill beyond .	1
there were two other ways out up through mount rocky , as they called that high hill , but that would mean a longer walk home .	1
kevin started moving forward out of the cellar and into the dank dark cave .	1
he felt his way with his hands on the cold stone walls .	1
missy held one arm out in front of herself , her fingertips brushing against kevins back , and her other hand against the stone walls .	1
they took baby steps and rounded the corner .	1
at first it was darker still .	1
there had been a little light seeping through the slats of the trapdoor , but now it was total and complete blackness .	1
they kept up the baby steps .	1
kevin had impressed missy the first time they came down here with how well he knew the caves .	1
he never seemed to get lost .	1
once he had been trapped down here by some awful people who were trying to keep the valuable pictograms undiscovered .	1
he had made his way through the tunnel maze , marking his path choices so he wouldnt keep going in circles , until finally he reached one of the mount rocky exits where missy and her friend , jessica , opened an invisible door and rescued him .	1
but now their first concern was avoiding the two older boys who would certainly be meaner than their brothers .	1
rob and dave had entered the caves in a rush to catch their younger brothers and had not seen the box of flashlights .	1
as soon as they had turned the first corner into the tunnels the light from above had vanished and rob had whipped out his cigarette lighter .	1
dave cursed when he remembered that his brother hadnt given him back his lighter when he was smoking in the car .	1
theyve got my lighter .	1
theyre probably way ahead by now , he said in a low voice .	1
give me your lighter .	1
ill lead .	1
dave grabbed robs hand and almost burned himself taking possession of the lighter .	1
he moved out in front and started the chase , stopping every little while to close the lighter to try to see another glow and to listen for voices .	1
they were well out of earshot when missy and kevin entered the caves , but that would change because they had taken a tunnel that led under the lake , exactly where missy and kevin needed to go .	1
out on the lake lonnie and ricky were having second thoughts .	1
they didnt care about imprisoning the little kids , but their brothers were going to beat them up bad if they figured out that they were responsible for trapping them .	1
maybe we should go back and move the stove , ricky said .	1
we can tell them that we were trapped , too , and some other lodge guests let us out .	1
lonnie thought about that for a while .	1
nah , he said , theyd figure out that was a lie , cuz how did we get out and the stove is still there ?	1
they paddled some more .	1
ricky was thinking that lonnie didnt make a lot of sense and his own idea was all right , but he didnt want to get into an argument with him .	1
though lonnie was small he was a mean little fighter and if ricky challenged lonnies reasoning lonnie might just tip the canoe over in anger .	1
the sun shone down intensely , not a cloud in the sky .	1
a crow cawed loudly and flew from one tree top to another before ricky ventured another solution : what if we say that we found another way out and then when they make us go down to the tunnels to show it to them we just act stupid and lost and cant find it again .	1
yeah , but theyll want to know where it came out up here .	1
oh , yeah , well .	1
.	1
.	1
ricky thought some more .	1
he stopped paddling and stared at the clear blue sky then he looked across the lake at the lodge and all the little log cabins .	1
i know !	1
well say that we came up through a trap door in one of the little cabins and ran out .	1
they wont dare go in somebody elses place .	1
yeah , lonnie agreed .	1
well say it was the first one , the one that old mr. stark lives in .	1
yeah , theyll believe that .	1
they began to paddle again , faster , and headed toward the lodge .	1
kevin finally decided that it was safe to turn on the flashlight .	1
he got his bearings and they turned down the tunnel that ran under the lake .	1
one of the first times he brought missy on this tunnel he had turned out the light to show her just how black it was down here .	1
he knew that if the older brothers were down here they would have to have matches or a lighter to have any chance of finding their way .	1
they walked without talking .	1
every time they came to a turn or a fork kevin stopped and motioned to missy to listen .	1
then he turned off the flashlight and they both strained to see any glimmer of light that there might be .	1
they became more and more confident that the older boys had not come in this direction .	1
hey , rob said , were gon na get lost down here .	1
we didnt take any string like we used to , to find our way back .	1
what are you ?	1
a sissy ?	1
dave teased .	1
ooo , were gon na get lost .	1
havent you noticed the little glow-in-the-dark reflector arrows ?	1
yeah , but they were all pointing the way we came from .	1
right , you moron , so we can find our way out .	1
dave laughed loudly and called rob several humiliating names .	1
come on , little baby , well head back .	1
lonnie and ricky must have taken a different tunnel .	1
theyre probably out and in our canoe by now .	1
shh , kevin said , i hear laughing .	1
he switched off the light and when their eyes adjusted they could see a faint shimmer .	1
kevin gave missy a little push and whispered , get back around the corner .	1
theyre coming this way .	1
they stumbled and felt their way around the corner then flattened themselves against the rock wall and waited .	1
missys heart started its hummingbird flapping again .	1
dave held the lighter high and illuminated the little reflectors that mr. jackson had recently posted .	1
no way would they get lost as long as the lighter held fluid .	1
with that thought he jiggled it a bit and figured it was at least half full .	1
he was kind of glad that he was wasting robs lighter and not his own .	1
if his little brother was using up his lighter he would just make him get another one , that is , steal one from his mom or dad , who both smoked .	1
is that you breathing so hard , moron ?	1
dave asked .	1
he looked back at rob who had stopped and had clamped his hand over his own mouth .	1
rob pointed with his other hand first to his ear and then down the tunnel .	1
dave heard it , too .	1
that little bit of noise must be coming from their brothers , probably they were hiding around the corner .	1
dave motioned to rob to stay put then he closed the lighter and waited .	1
missy and kevin stayed absolutely still .	1
missy willed herself to breathe quietly .	1
rob and dave were just as still in the total darkness .	1
no one moved .	1
two , three minutes passed .	1
turn the lighter back on , rob finally said , and lets go .	1
yeah , youre right .	1
nobodys down here , dave agreed , but he turned the lighter on and mouthed to rob theyre right there .	1
they noisily entered the next tunnel and pretended to head on .	1
missy and kevin slinked around the corner and headed away from the boys and farther down the tunnel under the lake .	1
when there was no more glow from the others lighter kevin switched on the flashlight .	1
lets hurry , he whispered .	1
you were right , rob said , and i think theyve got a flashlight .	1
where did they get that ?	1
lets get those little snots .	1
they jogged in pursuit as fast as they could without the flame blowing out .	1
dave kept yelling , were gon na get you !	1
oh , no , missy whimpered , go faster , kevin .	1
they were what would have been more than halfway back across the lake only underground , changing tunnels based on the color of the little arrow reflectors .	1
kevin knew exactly which way would lead to the end of the tunnels and the secret escape that he and missy and their friend jessica had discovered a few weeks ago .	1
if they could just reach the large cavern they could duck behind the drapery .	1
it hung over the opening completely and hid the entrance .	1
lettering that had been painted on the cloth announced : the end of the caves .	1
congratulations !	1
that ought to stop the boys .	1
they would think that they had taken a different route and would keep on searching .	1
dave stayed in front of rob by a couple of feet , but it was hard to follow the faint glow of the flashlight ahead with the lighter in front of his eyes .	1
you go first , rob , he said , unwilling to give up the lighter .	1
rob passed him and his eyes adjusted to following the fainter glow a dozen yards ahead .	1
we almost got you !	1
he shouted and then tripped on some loose gravel and sprawled headlong on the cave floor .	1
dave stumbled over robs legs and fell , his right knee landing hard on his friends back .	1
he reached out his hands to break the fall and the lighter flew to the side and went out .	1
ow , get off me , rob grunted .	1
dave rolled to the right and searched blindly for the lighter .	1
help me search for the lighter .	1
theyre getting away .	1
dave stretched out on his belly and extended his arms out moving them side to side as if he were making a face down snow angel .	1
he inched forward and repeated the action two more times before his fingertips felt the smooth side then the hot tip of their only hope of seeing in this cool black darkness .	1
found it .	1
he got up , lit the lighter and handed it to rob , who had a smudge of blood on his chin .	1
you hold it , miss tripsy , and ill go in front .	1
they quickly resumed their pursuit .	1
did you hear that ?	1
missy whispered .	1
sounds like they fell down .	1
yeah , maybe we can get far enough ahead that they wont know which tunnel we took .	1
kevin kept up a steady jog , but they couldnt go too fast or they would end up like their pursuers , sprawled on the hard rock floor .	1
he thought about ducking into one of the little caverns and turning off their flashlight , but the idea of hiding in what would amount to a dead end closet did not seem wise .	1
it sounded like the guys thought they were chasing their own brothers , but if they caught missy and him instead , it still wouldnt be good .	1
they came to a fork in the tunnels .	1
the left tunnel was a maze of interconnecting routes that looped around without any other exit .	1
the right tunnel would take them to the cavern with the hidden way out .	1
kevin didnt hesitate in choosing the right tunnel .	1
missy stayed close on his heels and they arrived at the cavern without a sound behind them .	1
kevin hurried to the drapery that hung over the exit .	1
he held it out and missy slipped under it and reached up for a handhold .	1
the tunnel up and out was a couple of feet above the floor of the cavern .	1
the drapery that hid it didnt reach the ground .	1
no one would suspect that the tunnel was even there since all the other tunnels were at the same level .	1
if the older boys found this cavern and saw the drape with its end of the caves message it was unlikely that they would guess it concealed a get-away .	1
kevin gave missy a boost and up she went .	1
she turned and reached for the flashlight and kevin easily jumped up and into the narrow passageway .	1
behind him the curtain fell back into place , quivering a little before settling back into its stillness .	1
they emerged from the tunnel into a smaller cavern that had stalactites and stalagmites .	1
they knew they were just below the lobby of the lodge and all they had to do was climb the ladder and pop through the trapdoor .	1
you have the key ?	1
kevin was still whispering .	1
missy pulled out a chain from around her neck on which hung two very distinctive keys .	1
she climbed the ladder first and unlocked the trapdoor .	1
she eased it open slowly , praying that no children were playing in this cute little area under the stairs where toys were stored .	1
rob and dave almost reached the fork in the tunnels when dave stopped and grabbed something off a niche in the cave wall .	1
hey , rob , look , i think i found a candle .	1
he held out a small votive candle , slighter larger than the ones his mother used to freshen the bathroom , and rob held the lighter to the wick .	1
great , now we dont have to waste any more lighter fluid .	1
dave said and rob closed the cap .	1
he almost stuck it back in his pocket then decided to wait until it cooled a bit first .	1
dave handed the candle to rob and reminded him to hold his hand in front of it so it wouldnt blow out .	1
dave turned to continue the hunt though there was no longer any ghost of light to follow .	1
they reached the fork and stared intently down each path , straining their eyes and ears .	1
im pretty sure theyd have to come back this way to get out .	1
we could just wait here , dave said .	1
or we could split up and you take the candle and ill use the lighter .	1
rob held the candle up high then down low .	1
i may be wrong , he said , but i think they took the right passage .	1
see how its scuffed up here ?	1
dave agreed and they followed the tunnel to the large cavern .	1
what the heck is this ?	1
rob said and he went right up close to the drapery and read the message by the flickering light .	1
dave cursed and blamed rob for making them go down the wrong tunnel .	1
theyre probably half way back by now !	1
he cursed again .	1
he wanted to throw something so he picked up a handful of loose stones and hurled them at the drapery then he plucked the candle from robs hand and led them back through the tunnels .	1
lonnie and ricky reached the lodges beach and dragged the canoe up next to the one they had earlier rescued .	1
we forgot one thing , ricky said , theyre gon na want to know how the canoe and paddles got put back .	1
we can shove it back out now , sink it , maybe .	1
um , i see your mom coming out the back door .	1
they ran across the beach and ducked into the woods out of her sight .	1
think of something else , ricky said .	1
okay , lonnie swatted at a mosquito , i know what we can say .	1
well tell them that we saw mr. jackson bringing it back .	1
they wont talk to him .	1
ricky agreed .	1
okay , lets go check out our room .	1
im glad our folks are letting us share .	1
my brother snores .	1
the boys laughed .	1
lets stay out here some more , lonnie said .	1
ricky usually let lonnie have his way so they headed deeper into the woods .	1
missy and kevin were in luck .	1
no little kids were in the playroom and they could emerge , relock the trapdoor and cover it up with a small rag rug .	1
missy peeked out of the playroom door and found the lobby empty , another bit of luck for them .	1
they dashed through the lobby and cut through the dining room .	1
when they reached the back porch a lady was heading out the screen door and they could see beyond her to the beach where lonnie and ricky were stepping out of the canoe .	1
they watched the boys glance toward the lodge then scurry off to the woods .	1
wow , missy said , we beat them back here .	1
yeah , kevin answered , which means that we cant beat the brothers back to the stone cottage to move the stove off the trap door .	1
i dont want to be there when they find out theyre trapped .	1
maybe its time to tell your dad how mean these guys are .	1
how mean what guys are ?	1
old mr. stark said .	1
he had come up behind them without a sound .	1
kevin and missy looked at each other first and when kevin shrugged his shoulders missy went ahead and told her great-grandfather what the two sets of brothers had just done .	1
well , the old man said , scratching at his beard and chuckling , serves those boys right to be trapped down there for a while .	1
a little punishments not a bad thing .	1
i dont suppose the younger brothers would go back and move the stove .	1
no , hmmm , he paused , ive got an idea .	1
since we wouldnt want their parents to panic when they dont show up for dinner , heres what you can do .	1
he bent closer and explained his solution .	1
chapter 3 lonnie and ricky explored the trails for a long time before sitting down on some mounded earth at the indian gravesite .	1
i heard theyve got horses here this summer .	1
can you ride ?	1
ricky asked .	1
no , can you ?	1
no , but it cant be hard .	1
i wonder where the stables are .	1
you dummy , lonnie said , dont you remember the barn and corral over there , he pointed , on the way to the cemetery ?	1
oh , yeah .	1
lets go check it out .	1
he didnt like being called a dummy but he let it go .	1
okay , but what about rob and dave ?	1
and the jackson kid and the girl ?	1
you want to go back and let them out already ?	1
ricky rolled his eyes .	1
i thought we agreed on our story .	1
right .	1
lonnie stood up .	1
lets see the stables .	1
the mama bear and her cubs had stopped to chomp on some berries .	1
when the patch was thoroughly destroyed they found some soft earth and started digging for grubs .	1
the fur on their backs was filthy with leaves and spider webs , dirt and broken pine needles .	1
their claws were sharp and their digging was fast and methodical .	1
they sifted through the dirt straining away all but the juicy , squirming grubs , centipedes , millipedes and an occasional earthworm , tasty protein to complement their vegetarian diet .	1
when the digging got harder one of the cubs started to wander away and the second cub chased after him .	1
soon mama bear finished her last morsel and turned her attention toward her offspring .	1
she meandered after them , still heading in the general direction of big pine lodge , but a good ways off yet .	1
one cub scratched at the bottom of a large leafy oak tree before climbing straight up .	1
the other cub followed closely .	1
what a scare they gave to a bunch of birds that had been resting in the upper branches .	1
the flock rose as one and noisily flew off .	1
it was still late morning , but in the afternoon kevin would have to open the snack shack , a little hut near the beach where he sold candy and chips and got to keep the profits .	1
missy had her duties , too .	1
she took care of the stable and guided the guests on horseback rides .	1
she had already cleaned the stable early this morning and no one was scheduled to ride until later so the two of them still had a couple of hours of free time .	1
they liked mr. starks idea .	1
for a very old man in his eighties he was smart and fun .	1
the two friends headed down the path to the stables , but stopped for a minute to pet a couple of the horses in the corral .	1
blackie was the smallest and friendliest and always available for a nose rubbing .	1
keno stuck his head over the fence , too , but the other two horses stayed in the center of the corral nibbling on some grass .	1
missy called their names and tried to coax them over but they ignored the kids .	1
i feel like i sort of lied to my dad , kevin admitted .	1
mr. jackson had agreed to let kevin and missy take the six-wheeled vehicle around the lake only after kevin had told him they were doing a favor for mr. stark .	1
im glad he didnt ask what the favor was .	1
well , i would have told him it was a surprise .	1
you know we better have an answer ready when we come back .	1
your dadll probably ask you tonight .	1
think , kevin said as he scratched keno behind the ears just like a dog , why would we need the six-wheeler ?	1
missy stared at the sky for a moment and watched one fluffy cloud change shape without moving on .	1
i know .	1
well pick some wildflowers .	1
well get enough for a bouquet and you can tell your dad that great-grandpa wants to give them to someone special .	1
okay , kevin said .	1
he gave keno one more pat and moved off toward the house and garage where he and his family lived when the lodge wasnt open .	1
missy followed him feeling a little bad herself for coming up with lies so easily .	1
the six-wheeled vehicle used to be kept in the stable before mr. stark surprised missy with four horses .	1
now it was kept in the garage .	1
its army green color made it look like a small tank .	1
there were three wheels on both sides , a front seat wide enough for two people and two small back seats facing each other .	1
instead of a steering wheel there were two handlebars that had to be pulled toward the driver to work the right and left brakes independently .	1
speed was controlled by a gas lever in the right handlebar .	1
kevin threw something in the backseat and then the kids hopped in and kevin started it up .	1
he sat on the right side to work the handlebars and missy , on the left , leaned forward and hung on to a smaller stationary handle with her left hand and put her right hand on the bar that ran along the back of the seat .	1
she was ready for what she knew kevin would do first and , sure enough , as soon as he was out of the garage he did it .	1
by giving the vehicle a lot of gas with the right handlebar and pulling forward hard with the left handlebar the little tank spun wildly in a tight circle .	1
then he reversed the spin by letting up on the left handlebar and pulling the right one back .	1
they spun clockwise and missy would have flown out if she hadnt been holding tightly to the bars .	1
they both laughed hard and he did a couple more spins and a crazy eight before they headed off down the horse trail and around the west side of the lake .	1
the path was sometimes bumpy and missy kept a firm grasp with one hand or the other all the time .	1
kevin had to hold on to both handlebars , but even though , he still bobbed out of the seat once in a while .	1
dave and rob reached the cellar of the stone cottage and struggled to open the trapdoor .	1
those little jerks mustve put something heavy over this .	1
they both shouted swear words and warnings and threats to their brothers who they were sure were just above them .	1
they stopped and listened and when they couldnt detect even a chuckle from above they decided that the boys had gone .	1
they sat down on the cold dirt floor by the ladder and discussed all the terrible things they would do to them when they got their hands on them .	1
shhh .	1
did you hear that ?	1
rob said .	1
they listened as the motorcycle-like roar of an engine got louder and louder then stopped .	1
they could hear footsteps on the plank floor .	1
sure that the people above werent their brothers they started yelling for help .	1
no one answered .	1
kevin and missy walked in to the stone cottage and stared at the stove deciding how best to do what old mr. stark had suggested .	1
when the boys below started yelling for help missy gasped and kevin smiled .	1
he thought about the time these same boys had tortured him and he was glad that they were feeling helpless .	1
quietly they took the rope that kevin had thrown in the backseat and tied it around the stove , then kevin looped it around the stove two more times so the stove would slide away and not tip over , just as mr. stark had instructed him .	1
missy followed him out the door as he unwound the rope , laying a trail from the cottage to the vehicle .	1
my dad taught me a whole bunch of sailors knots last winter , kevin explained as he fastened the end of the rope to the seat bar .	1
when were sure that weve moved the stove off the trapdoor , you pull this end .	1
see ?	1
then ill give it a lot of gas and hopefully well make it to the woods before those goons come out and see us .	1
missy nodded .	1
are we just gon na leave the rope ?	1
yeah .	1
i figure theyll be too angry to take the time to unknot it from the wood stove .	1
well get it later .	1
they climbed into the six-wheeler and kevin slowly gave it some gas .	1
missy watched the rope tighten up and lift off the ground .	1
she felt the tug when it lost all of its slack and began to pull the stove .	1
she was distracted for a second when a flock of birds flew right over them and landed in the trees nearby .	1
listen , rob said , its that motor again .	1
theyre leaving .	1
they started yelling help !	1
again then stopped when they heard a scraping sound above .	1
whoever it is , theyre moving something up there , dave said .	1
he started pushing up on the trapdoor .	1
it still wouldnt budge .	1
get up here and help me , dave ordered .	1
it was tight , but rob managed to stand on the rung below dave and reach up with his hands and push .	1
dave had his back hunched up and he was using his shoulder for leverage , his face looking down at the top of robs head .	1
above them the stove was slowly moving , leaving deep scratches in the old wood floor as it circled toward the front door .	1
harder !	1
dave demanded and before the stove was completely out of the way they forced the trapdoor up and toppled the heavy wood stove .	1
the thud was loud enough for missy and kevin to hear outside .	1
dave leaped through the opening just in time to see the rope go slack and hear an engine roar off .	1
he bolted for the door and , for an instant before they disappeared down the trail , he saw two people in a little green tank .	1
rob joined him .	1
who was that ?	1
dave snorted .	1
remember mr. jacksons utility vehicle ?	1
the one he wouldnt let us ride in ?	1
rob nodded .	1
well , his son and somebody else just drove away .	1
i think maybe they were the ones who trapped us down there .	1
ricky and lonnie may still be down in the caves .	1
rob turned and looked back at the open trapdoor .	1
dave met his gaze .	1
you thinkin what im thinkin ?	1
rob shut the trapdoor and helped dave upright the stove and scoot it back over the opening .	1
they high-fived each other and laughed hysterically .	1
i think he saw us , missy said .	1
he was probably the one you said was so mean , the one that was driving the car .	1
dave with dark hair .	1
kevin had to slow down now that they were in the woods , but he was still going faster than he had ever gone on this trail .	1
they bumped and knocked around on the seat , missy holding on for dear life , until kevin took a side trail out to the main road .	1
im not supposed to drive this on the road , kevin said , but theres never any traffic here and this is an emergency .	1
the smooth road was a relief and it would take them back to the house and stables much faster .	1
rob and dave were still laughing about pranking their brothers when they got down to the shore .	1
you idiot !	1
dave scolded rob .	1
you didnt beach the canoe .	1
its floated out somewhere .	1
what are you talking about ?	1
rob yelled back .	1
we beached it together and we threw the paddles right here .	1
somebody took it .	1
how long were we down there anyway ?	1
dave was scanning the lake and except for a fisherman in a rowboat there wasnt anyone else out beyond the swimming area across the lake .	1
i see both canoes over there .	1
what the .	1
.	1
. ?	1
maybe ricky and lonnie did get out first and they took the canoe back .	1
im gon na kill em , dave growled .	1
he started jogging toward the woods where the little utility vehicle had disappeared a few moments before .	1
wait , why are you going that way ?	1
its longer .	1
we can catch that tank , thats why .	1
come on .	1
kevin turned into the driveway and drove up to the garage .	1
he parked and turned the key off .	1
hold your ears , he warned .	1
they both clamped their hands over their ears and waited for the loud bang that often came after a wild ride .	1
the little vehicle seemed to protest harsh treatment by backfiring like a canon .	1
sure enough the earsplitting sound came seconds after he turned the key .	1
was that a gun ?	1
ricky looked at lonnie .	1
whod be shooting in the summer ?	1
maybe somebodys poaching out of season .	1
shooting a nice buck or doe , lonnie surmised .	1
look , theres the stable and theres four horses in the corral .	1
the boys started clucking and calling the animals over , but all four horses , even blackie , stayed out of reach and ignored them .	1
lets check out the stable since nobodys around , lonnie said .	1
they went into the tack room and ran their hands over the smooth leather of the saddles , handled the halters and reins , and thumped the riding helmets .	1
lonnie picked up a riding crop .	1
look at this little whip , he said and started flicking ricky with it .	1
ricky grabbed another one and they dueled as if they were having a sword fight .	1
when they got bored with that they tossed the crops on the ground and explored the rest of the stable .	1
there were a dozen stalls but all were empty except for four , which had mounds of straw on the floor and full water buckets .	1
as the trail became harder and harder to run on dave and rob gave up the chase and just walked .	1
they hardly talked at all .	1
off in the distance they heard a bang and started thinking about guns and hunting and deer and pheasant .	1
they didnt think at all about bear hunting .	1
we could go for a trail ride , have lunch and then go swimming before i have to open the snack shack , kevin suggested .	1
who do you want to ride ?	1
keno or johnny ?	1
missy always had dibs on misty .	1
misty was the tallest horse , totally black except for a white mark between his eyes .	1
keno and johnny werent quite as big and they were brown .	1
keno also had several lighter spots and he was the fastest and most obedient of the four horses .	1
blackie , small as a pony , was usually ridden by children .	1
ill ride johnny .	1
i like how calm he is and his trot is smoother .	1
kevin headed to the tack room while missy grabbed a couple of lead lines and climbed over the fence .	1
she walked toward johnny first talking softly and soothingly , calling his name .	1
before she reached him she turned and headed back to the hitching post , still encouraging johnny and expecting him to follow her .	1
sure enough , when she got there he was right at her shoulder and she clipped the two ends of the lead line to his halter and the post .	1
then she used the same trick on misty .	1
kevin came straight out into the corral from a door in the stable with one saddle , pad and bridle .	1
missy grabbed the saddle pad and threw it on johnnys back then held the bridle while kevin saddled him .	1
he would tighten the cinch before he mounted , but if he did it now it would just be too loose .	1
they had found that all four of the horses had a trick of bloating their stomachs up when they were saddled so the cinch wouldnt feel so tight .	1
it was dangerous for the rider because the saddle could slide over and pitch the rider to the ground when they were cantering around a corner .	1
hey , he said , the riding crops were on the floor in there .	1
thats weird .	1
missy was ready with the bridle and kevin slipped the halter down but kept the rope around johnnys neck while missy eased the bit into johnnys mouth , then she tied the reins to the hitch and he put the halter on a peg on the wall .	1
they both went back in to get the other tack and the helmets .	1
they sat on the bench and changed from sneakers to riding boots .	1
lonnie and ricky had heard the kids talking in the corral and spied around the corner on them .	1
they whispered back and forth .	1
how did they get out of the caves ?	1
there really must be another way out after all .	1
i want to know how they did it .	1
i feel like being nice .	1
lonnie smirked and ricky knew that they were going to scam the younger kids somehow .	1
they set their sneakers where the boots had been then strapped on their helmets .	1
this time missy grabbed a saddle and kevin carried the bridle and pad .	1
two steps to the door and .	1
.	1
.	1
what do we have here ?	1
lonnie said as he and ricky blocked their way .	1
getting a couple of horses ready for us ?	1
are you signed up ?	1
missy asked .	1
she was scared , but not as much as before because this stable was her responsibility .	1
sure are , lonnie lied .	1
have you ridden before ?	1
lots , he lied again .	1
something about that one little syllable made kevin think that maybe these guys had never ridden a horse .	1
he decided to test it .	1
do you need us to guide you on the trails ?	1
lonnie and ricky looked at each other and ricky shrugged his shoulders .	1
lonnie nodded his head .	1
yeah , i think so .	1
weve never ridden here , so your expert guidance would be greatly appreciated .	1
he smiled as nicely as he could .	1
missy thought that they should be yelling at them for being so mean to them before and trapping them in the caves , but it was her job to manage the stables and help out the guests who wanted to ride .	1
it seemed that all four of them were going to pretend that the trapping incident never happened .	1
come on , kevin said as he pushed passed them .	1
missy followed next and the two bullies trailed after .	1
they stood off to the side while misty was saddled , then kevin returned for more tack while missy got blackie and keno .	1
ten minutes later all four horses were ready and kevin handed out helmets .	1
he cinched up blackie and asked , okay , whos first ?	1
im not riding no pony , lonnie said .	1
ricky stepped forward , i dont mind , he said .	1
i hear ponies are fast .	1
hes not a pony , missy said .	1
hes just small .	1
she looked straight at lonnie and added , like some people .	1
ricky easily mounted and missy adjusted his stirrups for him before handing him the reins .	1
lonnie felt a bit angry by the girls remark and pointed at the tallest horse and said , ill ride him .	1
missy and kevin exchanged a look .	1
are you sure youve ridden before ?	1
kevin asked .	1
that horse , misty , can be hard to handle if you dont know what youre doing .	1
i know what im doing , lonnie huffed .	1
he walked up to the horses left side , put his foot in the stirrup and reached up for the saddle horn .	1
he pulled himself up hard and fell flat on his butt as his weight made the saddle slide around the horses belly .	1
if you knew what you were doing , youd know to tighten the cinch first , kevin said .	1
he burst out laughing and so did missy .	1
even ricky had to laugh .	1
stupid horse , was all that lonnie said .	1
he got up and walked over to johnny .	1
he figured out how to tighten the cinch then pulled on the saddle first to see if it would hold his weight .	1
he mounted the horse then realized hed have to ask one of them to untie the reins .	1
gim me the reins , he ordered .	1
missy handed them up and asked him if he wanted the stirrups adjusted .	1
theyre fine , he said , lets go .	1
the stirrups on johnnys saddle would have been fine for kevin but lonnie was three years older and six inches taller .	1
kevin and missy shared a secret smile as they fixed mistys saddle , opened the gate and then mounted their horses .	1
missy went through the opening first followed by lonnie on johnny .	1
blackie automatically started following since he was used to being on a lead line behind either misty or johnny .	1
kevin was last .	1
he had wanted to ride johnny , but keno was obedient and fast .	1
he could leave those two bullies in the dust any time he wanted .	1
missy led them down the trail she and kevin had taken earlier in the vehicle intending to split off onto the wider open path that missed the cottage and circled around mount rocky .	1
it wasnt actually a mountain just a really big hill that happened to hide the most clever entrance to the caves .	1
missys great-grandfather and her father had worked on a project to make it invisible and it had remained so for thirty years until missy had discovered the key to opening it .	1
she would never ever take these older boys up that particular path even if the horses could manage to duck under all the overhangs and make the tight twisted turns .	1
she looked back over her shoulder and smiled to herself when she saw how tightly the fifteen-year-olds were clasping the saddle horns .	1
hey , loosen up on the reins .	1
youre riding western not english .	1
lonnie just gave her an ill-do-what-i-want look , but ricky tried to make an adjustment .	1
blackie stumbled over a root and pitched ricky forward onto his neck .	1
ricky let out a yell but succeeded in regaining his seat .	1
from behind him kevin chuckled .	1
lonnie and missy looked back in time to see the surprised look on rickys face .	1
that sounded just like my brother , rob said when they heard a yell coming from the direction they were headed .	1
he started to speed up , but dave pulled him back .	1
check out these trees .	1
easy climbing .	1
if its our brothers we can scare the crap out of them .	1
if its some other people , well stay hidden .	1
rob agreed and they climbed trees across from each other and perched themselves above the trail .	1
misty , missys horse , gave a little nicker and snort as they rounded a bend in the trail .	1
he had done that a couple of times before this summer and it always warned missy of hikers on the trail .	1
her first thought was of the older boys they had freed from the caves .	1
it would make sense that they would follow them back on this trail .	1
she was mad at herself for not thinking of that sooner and her head was racing with ideas of what to do next .	1
there was no room to turn the horses around right here .	1
she could just stop and wait , but theyd still be stuck with nowhere to go .	1
her only option was to start to trot .	1
the boys would have to jump into the woods to avoid being run over .	1
when the riders reached the open path then they could canter and put more distance between them .	1
okay , were gon na trot now , she hollered back over her shoulder .	1
she clucked at misty and squeezed her knees .	1
trot !	1
she ordered .	1
he obeyed her immediately .	1
johnny and blackie followed at a trot , bobbing their untrained riders up and down .	1
keno waited for kevins command then trotted smoothly behind blackie .	1
dave and rob heard the girls commands and thought that they would just stay hidden .	1
they had no idea how many people were heading their way or who they were for sure until they heard daves brother complaining to slow down , that this was killing his butt .	1
the first horse passed beneath them snorting and tossing his head .	1
then came their brothers .	1
dave and rob let out warrior-like hollers and swung down from the branches .	1
johnny whinnied and sidestepped , scraping lonnies leg against a tree trunk .	1
kevin halted keno as soon as he saw the two goons drop from the branches .	1
he could see missy having a hard time reining in misty who probably wanted to gallop away .	1
surprised to see us ?	1
dave shouted .	1
that was just enough to send johnny over the edge .	1
he pushed into mistys left flank and tried to pass .	1
the bigger horse stopped paying attention to his rider and ran up the tight path until it opened into the wider trail .	1
johnny stayed on his tail with lonnie gripping the saddle horn and the horses mane .	1
little blackie was just as spooked and he chased after the others with ricky clinging like a monkey .	1
that was hilarious !	1
dave laughed .	1
he looked back at kevin .	1
what about you jackson ?	1
is that nag too old to run or what ?	1
rob started after the others , just a little worried about what could happen to his brother and how much trouble hed be in if his parents found out .	1
dave , however , was feeling a lot less sympathetic .	1
come here , jackson .	1
get off that horse .	1
kevin was glad he was on the obedient gelding and instead of being intimidated by the seventeen-year-old , he crouched down and gave keno a definite command .	1
the rumble of horses hooves was only audible to the sharpest of ears in the forest .	1
the young bear cubs couldnt have been less interested .	1
it was all fun and food for them .	1
their mother was pushing them onward now .	1
something else was in the air .	1
some scent that alerted her taste buds and persuaded her to pick up the speed .	1
they were still headed southwest .	1
missy let misty have her head .	1
she knew that the frightened animal would calm down after a little run .	1
after the wide path there would be an open area then it was back to tight trails and her horse would have to slow down by then .	1
she could hear the boys shrieking behind her and wondered how long before she heard a thud and one or both of them would be on the ground .	1
at least they were riding the slowest horses ; they wouldnt be hard to catch later .	1
lonnies stirrups were too short and hed lost hold of one of the reins .	1
he was shouting for help , but that stupid girl was just galloping her horse farther away .	1
he couldnt even think about looking behind to see where the others were .	1
ricky was starting to like blackies canter .	1
he had stopped bellowing for help when the trot had smoothed into a canter .	1
at first clods of dirt were flying in his face from the horse ahead , but in this wider area blackie had moved over and now he could see where they were headed .	1
he didnt hear the jackson kid behind him , though , and he briefly wondered if his brother and dave were torturing him .	1
keno bolted up the trail and kevin hollered at the older boys to look out .	1
they jumped off the trail just in time .	1
kevin and keno zigzagged until they rounded the last bend and opened up speed on the wide straightaway .	1
the others were out of sight .	1
kevin urged keno into a full gallop and then slowed to a regular canter when he caught a glimpse of blackies rump .	1
by the time kevin joined the group everyone was back to a trot and they continued at that speed until missy was satisfied that her horse was over its fright .	1
when she finally stopped they were at the bottom of mount rocky .	1
missy couldnt help but scold the bullies , your brothers are jerks !	1
we could have broken our necks !	1
they could have been trampled !	1
dont they have any brains ?	1
lonnie and ricky silently agreed but they werent about to join her in her contempt .	1
but kevin was .	1
yeah .	1
what morons .	1
they should be banned from the lodge .	1
and so should you , he thought .	1
lonnie wanted to find out about how the kids got out of the cave .	1
now that dave and rob were out , too , maybe they had learned the secret for themselves .	1
there was no way the older guys would ever let them in on it so their only hope was to coax the information out of kevin and the girl .	1
he swallowed his pride and said , hey , we never found out your name .	1
im lonnie and this is ricky .	1
missy didnt smile .	1
im missy stark .	1
my great-grandfather owns big pine lodge .	1
her horse started to pull the reins as he stretched his neck down , trying to reach some light green foliage that must have looked tasty to him .	1
missy pulled his head up and straightened around in the saddle .	1
lets finish your ride .	1
she signaled for a walk and led the group on .	1
wait , lonnie said , trailing behind her .	1
tell us how you got out of the caves .	1
we know theres another way out , isnt there ?	1
our brothers must have found it .	1
we let them out !	1
kevin hollered from the end of the line .	1
he patted kenos neck and felt the heat radiating off the animals hide .	1
but how did you guys get out ?	1
ricky piped up .	1
if its a secret , you can trust us .	1
wed never tell our brothers .	1
yeah , right , missy thought .	1
instead of giving a false answer she just didnt say anything .	1
come on , lonnie begged .	1
were , uh , were sorry we trapped you down there .	1
it was just a joke .	1
we were gon na let you out in five minutes .	1
i swear .	1
missy continued to ignore him and kevin stayed silent , too .	1
chapter 4 dave and rob were sweaty and hungry when they finally reached the lodge .	1
there were sandwiches set out in the dining hall and they helped themselves .	1
they sat down at a small table next to their moms who were halfway through their lunches .	1
where have you two been ?	1
daves mom asked .	1
around , dave answered .	1
his mother didnt press for a better answer and took another bite .	1
robs mother brushed her bleached blonde hair out of her eyes and patted her mouth with her napkin .	1
i dont want any trouble this year , she warned .	1
theyve got horses here this summer and i want you and ricky to keep away from the stables .	1
rob glanced at dave and raised an eyebrow .	1
rickys already riding , ma .	1
what !	1
she started to rise from her chair then sat back down .	1
oh , just wait till your father gets back from golfing .	1
then daves mother looked at dave .	1
i suppose your brother is riding , too ?	1
yup , dave said , last we saw of them they were galloping through the woods .	1
we tried to stop them , but they wouldnt listen to us .	1
the two mothers looked at each other then one of them said , oh , well , boys will be boys .	1
they both laughed , finished their food , picked up their beach bags and headed out .	1
daves mother turned back a second and handed dave two room keys .	1
here , she said , we unpacked your suitcases .	1
your room is 212 and the other key you can give to your brother .	1
he and ricky are in 214 .	1
rob yelled after his mother for his key and she told them that the second keys were on the dressers in both rooms .	1
two more people came in to the dining room after the women left so the boys kept their voices low as they planned out a little surprise for lonnie and ricky .	1
daves mom never should have trusted him with lonnies key .	1
lonnie and ricky were starting to get sore bottoms .	1
every time missy trotted her horse their horses followed suit and they bumped up and down without control .	1
ricky glanced back at kevin once and saw that he seemed to being sitting the trot like a cowboy .	1
he couldnt figure out how to do it .	1
they circled around half of mount rocky before reaching a two-lane road .	1
missy stopped her horse and held up her hand .	1
we can go back to the stable now or cross over onto state land and ride in there for another half hour .	1
the trails are wider and smoother and theres a nice meadow we can canter through .	1
lonnie looked back at ricky who gave his head a little shake .	1
he was aching and hungry .	1
another time , lonnie said .	1
we have to get back for lunch .	1
whatever , missy said .	1
she looked up and down the road .	1
there were rarely any cars that went by here .	1
she led them in a circle , but as she looped by kevin she motioned with her head for him to cut in behind her .	1
as they backtracked on the trail now kevin and missy were together with the bullies behind them .	1
payback time , she whispered to kevin .	1
she gently urged misty into his slowest canter and kevin did the same with keno .	1
the two horses kept pace and the kids sat on their saddles as comfortably as if they were on the merry-go-round .	1
johnny and blackie , however , kept up by trotting as fast as they could .	1
they wouldnt change their gait into a canter unless instructed to do so by their riders .	1
lonnie and ricky had no idea how to make the horses change gaits .	1
it was all they could do to hang on and bounce up and down painfully .	1
at last they reached the area where dave and rob had attacked them and the trail narrowed .	1
missy slowed to a trot and finally a walk .	1
the last stretch was long enough for the horses to all cool down .	1
she had already decided that she was going to make these jerks rub down their horses themselves , a job that she always did .	1
her great-grandfather wouldnt object , she was sure .	1
dave and robs room was actually connected to 214 by two interior doors that could be locked from one side only .	1
apparently their mothers had left the doors open when they unpacked everything .	1
they checked out their room , nothing fancy , two twin beds and a bathroom , then looked at the other room .	1
it was exactly the same .	1
on their way out of the dining room they had each sneakily made off with a handful of little ketchup packets .	1
now the plan they had hatched seemed kind of lame .	1
they were going to put ketchup in all of their brothers underwear or in the pockets of their jeans .	1
think of something else , dave said .	1
this is stupid .	1
he tossed his handful of ketchup into the wastebasket .	1
squeeze out all their toothpaste ?	1
lame .	1
t.p .	1
their room ?	1
dumb .	1
you think of something .	1
dave walked over to the window and looked down at the beach .	1
i know .	1
sand .	1
just a little sand in their sheets .	1
theyll be itching all night .	1
he went into the bathroom and took the two plastic wrapped drinking cups that were provided and tossed one to rob .	1
a cupful ought to do it .	1
missy rode into the corral and dismounted .	1
she quickly tied misty to the hitching post and hurried over to the gate in order to close it as soon as the last horse and rider were in .	1
kevin had tied up keno and was already unsaddling him , but johnny and blackie had headed straight for the water trough and lonnie and ricky had no control .	1
get me off this nag , lonnie muttered .	1
he tossed the reins over the horses head and into the water .	1
he started to swing his left leg over the horses rump and accidentally kicked ricky in the knee .	1
hey !	1
watch it !	1
ricky scolded , then he laughed as lonnie tumbled to the trampled earth , his weak knees giving way as soon as his feet hit the ground .	1
ricky was afraid the same thing would happen to him so he was extra careful as he dismounted .	1
he didnt let go of the saddle until he was certain his legs would hold him .	1
missy and kevin had already put their saddles away and were coming back out just in time to see lonnie get up and brush himself off , all the time cussing out the poor horse .	1
okay , thats enough water .	1
bring them over here , missy commanded .	1
you have to unsaddle them and then rub them down .	1
fat chance , girlie .	1
i dont think so .	1
lonnie huffed and spit on the ground .	1
he walked as steadily as he could to the gate and let himself out .	1
come on ricky .	1
lets go eat .	1
ricky stumbled after him and was just nice enough to latch the gate behind himself .	1
missy and kevin watched the two boys walk bow-legged off toward the lodge .	1
impulsively missy called after them , too bad !	1
we would have told you about the other cave entrance !	1
the boys kept walking .	1
the lodge had two cooks who prepared all the meals for the guests in the lodge .	1
today they had baked several fruit pies and had set them all on the kitchen windowsills to cool .	1
the delicious aroma wafted out toward the beach where several adults commented on the smell , the ladies all delighting in the luxury of a week off from cooking and cleaning .	1
the same appetizing scent reached the sharper nostrils of three bears still wandering in the forest .	1
dave and rob pulled back the bedspread and top sheet of each twin bed then spread the sand on the lower half of the bottom sheet .	1
they remade the beds with more care than they had ever done their own in the past then high-fived each other .	1
they slipped back into their own room and locked the adjoining door from their side .	1
they hoped that their brothers wouldnt think to bolt their side so they could sneak back in whenever they wanted .	1
they changed into their bathing suits and grabbed a couple of bath towels .	1
okay , dave announced as he ran his fingers through his hair , time to check out the beach and the available female flesh .	1
rob grabbed his key off the dresser and stuck it in a little zippered pocket on his suit .	1
ready , he said .	1
lonnie and ricky stopped near the kitchen windows and gaped at the pies .	1
i hope those are for lunch , lonnie said .	1
probably not , ricky said .	1
oh , i dont know about that , lonnie said as he glanced around to see if anyone was watching .	1
he took two steps toward the window when he heard the porch door creak open and saw his brother and rob step out .	1
he cursed and said , yeah , i guess well have to wait for dinner .	1
come on .	1
dont let them see us .	1
they back tracked around the side and circled the lodge .	1
they entered through the front door and cut through the lobby to the dining room .	1
luckily there were a few sandwiches left .	1
they didnt even sit down to devour them ; they stood at the window and watched their brothers try to flirt with a couple of high school girls .	1
when they finished their food they searched out their mothers to get their room key .	1
they werent very happy to find out that theyd have to ask dave for their key .	1
it took missy and kevin a half an hour to get all four horses rubbed down .	1
missy was glad for kevins help since she usually had to do it all by herself .	1
she didnt mind the work , but today she was starving for lunch and wanted a little time to take a dip in the lake before she had to take a couple of lodge guests out on the trails this afternoon .	1
kevin wasnt opening the snack shack until 3 oclock so hed have plenty of time to swim , too .	1
when they finally made it back to the lodge all of the lunch items were cleared away .	1
kevin coaxed one of the cooks into making them grilled cheese sandwiches and they ate them in the kitchen , sitting on a couple of stools at one of the prep stations .	1
missy kept eying the pies on the windowsills while kevin talked to the cook about her son who kevin knew from school .	1
ill be right back , missy said , getting off the stool and heading toward the lobby .	1
she munched the last of her sandwich and wiped her hands on her jeans .	1
there was a small office in the lobby where kevins mom , mrs. jackson , could often be found .	1
missy wanted to check the sign-up sheet for horse-back-riding that was kept on the counter there .	1
hi , missy , mrs. jackson greeted her .	1
she was always so friendly and happy .	1
everyone liked mrs. jackson .	1
missy loved the story about how mr. and mrs. jackson had met at the lodge when they both worked here when they were off from college in the summers .	1
that was like forever ago , when the lodge had another wing before it burned and also when they had lots of horses .	1
mr. jackson had been a stable boy and mrs. jackson had been a maid .	1
now they managed the place and were in the process of buying it from missys great-grandfather .	1
they would get all the property , too , except for the little stone cottage across the lake , which mr. stark had said that missy would inherit .	1
hi , mrs. jackson .	1
are there any more people signed up to ride ?	1
she asked .	1
no , honey , youve just got the one couple .	1
nobody tomorrow , of course , since its sunday , but monday and tuesday are full .	1
looks like youll be riding all day long .	1
i dont mind .	1
i love it .	1
missy looked at the list and was happy to see that the bullies names werent under monday or tuesday .	1
hey , she said when she noticed that their names also werent written down for today .	1
whats the matter , dear ?	1
oh , nothing , well , yeah .	1
these boys said they were signed up and we took them out riding , but , she paused and turned the sheet toward mrs. jackson , they werent signed up .	1
let me guess , dave and rob ?	1
mrs. jackson scowled , raising one eyebrow for a question mark .	1
no , their brothers , lonnie and ricky .	1
mrs. jackson shook her head and thought for a moment .	1
tell you what .	1
if they try that stunt again , ask them for a riding coupon .	1
i was already thinking of typing up a form people would have to sign releasing us from liability .	1
liability ?	1
that means so they cant sue us if they fall off and get hurt .	1
they ride at their own risk .	1
ill have a tear-off portion at the bottom where ill write in their names and the time of their ride .	1
they can hand that to you .	1
that will be the riding coupon .	1
okay ?	1
okay .	1
give us our keys .	1
lonnie and ricky came up behind their brothers just as the pretty girls they were talking to started to laugh .	1
the girls were more likely in the same grade as the younger boys , but dave and rob got there first .	1
they both stood up blocking the boys from getting a closer look at the bikini-clad blondes .	1
here , dave shoved a key at lonnie , get lost .	1
wheres mine ?	1
ricky asked his brother .	1
on the dresser in your room .	1
adis , hermano .	1
because he knew it would bug his brother , lonnie peaked around him and smiled at the girls .	1
hi , im lonnie , he said , and this is ricky .	1
see you at the campfire .	1
they quickly made their exit , jogging up the beach , across the grass and into the lodge , anxious to find their rooms and get changed into swimsuits .	1
the rest of the afternoon was fun for everyone .	1
lonnie and ricky dove into the water , swam past the dock and continued on across the lake .	1
they were hoping to better their time of thirty minutes , a goal they had set for themselves last summer and only achieved once .	1
missy and kevin swam out to the dock and played underwater tag with three kids , one of whom kevin knew from previous summers .	1
dave and rob never got into the water .	1
they succeeded in talking the two girls into walking around to the front of the lodge and sitting on the front porch with them , out of sight and earshot of all of the adults .	1
later , kevin opened the snack shack and sold a dozen sodas , four bags of potato chips and six candy bars for a profit of $ 8.80 , his slowest day so far this summer .	1
missy guided a newly married couple on the trails and into the state forest and back .	1
they saw a doe and her two spotted fawns and this prompted the couple to ask questions about the wildlife .	1
the wife had heard a rumor that there were mountain lions around .	1
missy assured them that the rumor was false .	1
she did tell them , however , that they had recently trapped and relocated a couple of harmless bobcats .	1
the rumor probably started because of that .	1
missy guaranteed them that there were no dangerous animals at big pine lodge , no mountain lions , bobcats or bears .	1
the wife seemed relieved .	1
when they got back to the stables the husband gave missy a five-dollar tip .	1
chapter 5 it was a perfect july evening , warm , not too humid and with very few mosquitoes .	1
the sun was due to set in half an hour and kevin and mr. jackson were getting the wood ready for the bon fire that was a lodge tradition .	1
it was always exciting on saturday nights because most of the guests stayed for just one week and this would be their first bon fire .	1
everyone would gather at dusk and anyone who hadnt already met that afternoon would get acquainted at the fire .	1
the kids would roast marshmallows , someone would sing a song or two , mrs. jackson would bring out popcorn , and after it got really dark , there were always scary stories told .	1
missy had showered before dinner and then spent a few minutes on the phone to her mother who had to work in the city and only came up to the lodge a few times during the summer .	1
missy ate dinner with her great-grandfather and a family from georgia who had been coming up to the lodge for over twenty years .	1
the conversation was sometimes boring and sometimes interesting .	1
the two daughters were in high school , at least four years older than missy and not likely to be friendly with her because of the age difference .	1
they were very pretty blonde girls who talked with an accent that reminded missy of the characters in an old movie about the civil war , one that she had watched with her mom last winter .	1
the girls , melanie and tara , kept smiling over at dave and rob throughout dinner .	1
as soon as she finished her dessert missy headed back to her room .	1
she shared one of the first floor lodge rooms with angela , a college girl who worked here summers as a maid .	1
angela had skipped dinner to go out with the other maids to a pizza place twenty miles away .	1
missy flopped on the bed and let out a big sigh .	1
she wanted to be pretty like the georgia girls and have boys flirt with her .	1
whats the matter ?	1
angela surprised her , popping out of the bathroom , a hairbrush in one hand .	1
oh , i thought you were gone already , missy sat up .	1
not for another ten minutes , courtneys the slowest person to get ready .	1
angela pointed the brush at missy , so , tell me , what are you sighing about ?	1
kevin ?	1
no , missy answered quickly , its just , well , i wish i could wear make-up like you .	1
angela started to laugh .	1
wait a sec , she turned and went back into the bathroom .	1
a moment later she came out with a pink bag with a bow on the side .	1
your mother gave me this to give to you if you ever got sick or sad .	1
she handed it over .	1
what is it ?	1
missy was suddenly very excited .	1
it wasnt even her birthday .	1
it was so unexpected to get a gift .	1
she had the best mother ever .	1
open it and see .	1
she wasted no time and poured out the contents onto the bedspread .	1
it looked like her mother had bought something from every shelf in the cosmetics aisle .	1
now dont go overboard , angela warned , less is more , as they say .	1
try one thing , like the mascara , and save the rest .	1
work into growing up gradually .	1
trust me , youll be old before you know it .	1
mr. jackson usually let kevin light the fire and tonight was no different .	1
kevin was fascinated by fire and mr. stark used to call him sparky when he was smaller .	1
the pet name stuck for a few years , but now mr. stark just called him kevin , not wanting to take a chance of embarrassing him with the nickname .	1
kevin had used small sticks , dead leaves and some birch bark as his base , then placed larger dry branches in a teepee formation around the tinder .	1
it took only one match to get the flames going .	1
he steadily added more wood from the pile they had nearby .	1
his dad set up lawn chairs in a circle around the fire .	1
one by one families came out and settled around the blaze .	1
kevin took two water buckets to the lake and filled them up .	1
they liked to have them close by for drenching the coals later .	1
the sun set and the cloudless night sky was a wonder of constellations .	1
without the competing lights from big cities the stars were bolder in their sparkling glory and the adults commented over and over about how bright the stars were in the country .	1
one dad was pointing out orions belt and the big dipper .	1
a three-year-old started singing twinkle twinkle little star and everyone clapped when she finished .	1
everyone except lonnie and ricky , who were standing at the dark edge of the circle whispering to one another .	1
kevin looked around for missy who hadnt shown up yet .	1
it wasnt like her to miss a bonfire .	1
he also didnt see the older brothers .	1
what could they be up to ?	1
maybe they were bothering missy .	1
he glanced at mr. stark and then decided to check on things himself .	1
he threw one more branch in the fire and walked into the woods as if he were gathering more wood .	1
he skirted around behind lonnie and ricky and saw one of them pushing something under a ladys chair with his foot .	1
a rock , maybe .	1
he couldnt tell , but they were chuckling about it and moving sideways , away from her .	1
last year they had set off a bunch of firecrackers at the bonfire and there had almost been a fight between some of the dads and the boys parents .	1
it would be incredibly stupid of them to repeat that , especially at the first campfire .	1
theyd be asked to leave for sure .	1
kevin looked toward the lodge and picked his way along the path .	1
his night vision was pretty good and he didnt have any trouble going along .	1
the sounds of the group around the fire faded and he could pick up some new sounds laughter , giggling and whispering .	1
he swung his head in the direction of the voices and saw four silhouettes down at the shore .	1
it looked like there were two people sitting in one beached canoe and another couple on the sand .	1
he stopped and stared until he was sure it was dave , rob and the two pretty sisters he had waited on in the snack shack .	1
spying ?	1
missy startled him .	1
hey , where have you been ?	1
kevin answered .	1
just doing stuff in my room .	1
missy batted her eyelashes , but it was too dark for kevin to notice anything different about her .	1
well , come on .	1
i already started the fire .	1
looks like those two jerks arent going to be joining us , but their brothers are there and theyre acting pretty suspicious .	1
last year they let off some firecrackers .	1
i kind of hope they do that again so my folks and your great-grandpa will kick them all out .	1
kevin turned and led the way back .	1
dave and rob were trying their best to win points with melanie and tara .	1
though all four of them had been coming to big pine lodge for many years they didnt remember being there on the same week , though melanie admitted to seeing the boys leaving last year on the same day they were arriving .	1
secretly , dave was relieved that they didnt remember four summers ago when he and rob had chased several girls off the swimming dock .	1
he was pretty sure that melanie and tara were among the ones they had splashed and teased and called names .	1
they hadnt been interested in girls back then especially not skinny little giggling girls who screamed at spiders , snakes and toads .	1
i can see the bonfire , melanie stated , but she made no move to get up .	1
yup , same old bonfire , dave answered .	1
we should have our own .	1
what ?	1
here on the beach ?	1
tara looked around .	1
rob shook his head .	1
nah , theyd make us put it out .	1
lets go through the woods over to the old settlers ruins .	1
theres an old fireplace in the cabin ruins .	1
melanie and tara looked at each other and seemed to come to the same conclusion .	1
sure , why not ?	1
they said together .	1
missy and kevin skirted around behind lonnie and ricky and stood just outside the circle of golden light thrown off by the roaring blaze .	1
someone else had been adding logs to the fire and it was as high as a man .	1
parents were keeping their smaller children back and , in fact , were scooting their own chairs away from the heat .	1
missy glanced over at lonnie and ricky and saw that one was nudging the other .	1
suddenly there was an embarrassing farting noise from one of the ladies .	1
the little kids laughed out loud while the grownups tried to act like nothing happened .	1
lonnie and ricky bent over double , laughing their heads off .	1
as soon as they straightened up the loud farts began again .	1
the lady stood up .	1
its not me !	1
she said and picked up her chair to move away .	1
ricky moved into the spot she had left and motioned for lonnie to join him .	1
they stood there with their hands in their pockets trying not to laugh anymore .	1
as soon as everyones attention turned to a father who was grabbing a burning marshmallow stick from his son , lonnie bent down and picked up a dark object .	1
he stuffed it under his armpit and folded his arms .	1
whats he doing ?	1
missy whispered to kevin .	1
they had looped around to the beach side of the fire and had a good view of the boys .	1
i think i know , kevin said as he put two boards across the water buckets , cleverly making two seats for them .	1
they sat down carefully and kevin put his hand in front of his mouth , leaned toward missy and whispered .	1
watch what lonnie does with that thing under his arm .	1
just then mrs. jackson appeared with two huge bags of popcorn and last sundays newspaper .	1
help me , kevin .	1
please .	1
she set one bag down next to mr. stark , a safe place , she assumed , and handed the papers to kevin .	1
he gave half to mr. stark and the two of them began to fold pages of newspaper into cones .	1
missy jumped up to help and as mrs. jackson poured popcorn into the cones missy took them and handed them out to everyone around the fire .	1
she started at her left and went clockwise around , but when she got to lonnie and rickys spot they had moved over to mr. stark .	1
that was strange , she thought , because now theyd be last to get any .	1
she watched to see if they were just helping themselves to the second bag , but no , mrs. jackson was pouring from that one now .	1
when she finally handed them their popcorn they took them without a word and walked back to where they had been .	1
missy and kevin got theirs last and sat down on their makeshift seats to eat .	1
the campfire was burning down some now since no one wanted to feed the fire .	1
people were throwing their unpopped kernels into it hoping theyd pop .	1
a few of them did and if they exploded and flew out of the fire everyone would laugh .	1
one by one each person crumbled up his or her empty newspaper cone and tossed it into the bonfire .	1
the flames were blue or yellow and everyone seemed mesmerized and hypnotized by the dancing curls of flame .	1
there were a few moments of complete silence and then it was broken .	1
a long disgusting eruption of farting sounds came from mr. stark .	1
this time no one laughed and mr. stark just reached under his chair and brought out an object about the size of a deck of cards .	1
okay , he said , you can all laugh .	1
its just a remote control farting machine .	1
he waved it above his head and then he pressed a button on its side several times and the same noises came forth in short little bursts .	1
everyone laughed as he flicked another switch off and stuck the box in his jacket pocket .	1
kevin leaned toward missy .	1
thats what i thought .	1
look at lonnie and ricky .	1
theyre sneaking away .	1
good .	1
i hope my great-grandpa keeps it till their last day here .	1
it was kinda funny , though .	1
yeah , and at least it didnt hurt anybody .	1
that was hilarious , ricky said .	1
yeah , until that old fart found it .	1
who would have thought such an old man would have known how to turn it on and off , lonnie said .	1
were gon na have to steal it back now .	1
or , ricky thought for a second , we just torture a certain little someone into retrieving it for us .	1
lonnie chuckled .	1
yeah , i like your thinking .	1
they came out of the path near the back of the lodge and looked around for their brothers .	1
they checked inside and made a pit stop in the bathroom .	1
while lonnie waited for ricky he looked out from their second floor window .	1
if he stood to the right he could angle his view to the left and see the large bonfire .	1
straight ahead the moon was now reflecting off the lake which was as still as a mirror .	1
he moved left just as he heard ricky flush .	1
hey !	1
he hollered .	1
come here .	1
check this out .	1
ricky came out and crossed the room .	1
what ?	1
lonnie pointed to the right and scooted back so ricky could take his spot .	1
ricky put his cheek up against the screen and let his eyes adjust to the darkness .	1
yeah , so ?	1
looks like somebody has a fire over near the settlers ruins .	1
who do you think , dummy ?	1
i didnt see our brothers or those two girls from the beach at the bonfire , did you ?	1
ricky looked at lonnie .	1
quick .	1
lets change into all black clothing .	1
whats your idea ?	1
just spying ?	1
catch them at an embarrassing moment ?	1
ricky looked thoughtful .	1
he glanced around the room and his gaze settled on the extra blankets and pillows on the shelf .	1
turn the lights off , he ordered .	1
he grabbed a blanket and threw it over his shoulders while lonnie headed for the light switch .	1
by the time lonnie hit the switch and turned around ricky was on the floor with the blanket covering his head as well .	1
he let out some low growls then asked , well ?	1
am i a bear or what ?	1
lonnie flicked the switch back on and laughed , well , you probably wouldnt fool a real bear , but i think a couple of girls would fall for it .	1
especially with some snorts and some leaves rustling .	1
he pulled the second blanket off the shelf , thinking how lucky it was that both blankets were dark blue .	1
ricky got up , rolled his blanket up and the two of them started out the door .	1
well , hello , boys .	1
both sets of parents were just arriving .	1
did we miss the bonfire ?	1
we didnt mean to stay at that bar quite so long .	1
lonnies father patted them both on the shoulders .	1
you didnt miss anything , lonnie said .	1
we were just there .	1
same old , same old .	1
marshballows , popcorn , fire .	1
oh , lets make an appearance , dear , lonnies mother said .	1
she smiled and added , after a little bathroom break , that is .	1
the adults all nodded at each other and disappeared into their rooms without one question to the boys about why they were carrying blankets .	1
lonnie and ricky slipped down the staircase .	1

she screamed for tommy to help her as she dug her heels into the rocky path and scratched at the arms squeezing her middle .	1
tommys face registered disbelief as he reached for noelle and struggled to free her .	1
he gripped her hands and pulled her toward him .	1
he felt encouraged as she seemed to move forward , her head dropping down , long blonde curls hiding her face , but she collapsed over on herself like a clam as her stomach was pulled back into nothingness and her feet actually lifted up and off the ground .	1
tommy still couldnt see anyone other than the hairy arms magically coming out of thin air .	1
he dug in his heels and yanked his friend with all his might .	1
their hands slipped apart and incredibly noelle was sucked through the air with a whoosh and disappeared .	1
tommy fell on his butt , mouth open in shock .	1
it was as if noelle had been captured through a rip in reality .	1
now what would he do ?	1
he had escaped this strange land once before , but how could he go back without noelle ?	1
how could he explain this ?	1
surely they would lock him away in a dark and scary mental institution , a loony bin , a coo-coo cage , a padded room , never to return to 6th grade , never to make it to junior high .	1
tommy slapped his hands to the sides of his head .	1
he squinted his eyes tightly shut and was about to holler as loud as he could when another idea smacked him on the forehead .	1
of course !	1
he breathed aloud .	1
she must have been taken to the dungeon !	1
he pushed himself up off the rocky path and looked at the spot where noelle had disappeared .	1
he felt around blindly with his hands , feeling for something , anything , where she had been .	1
he circled around to stand behind the spot and reached up and down and patted the air .	1
he looked like a circus mime trying to find his way out of an invisible box , but when he pressed the air in one certain spot his finger disappeared .	1
oh !	1
he jerked back then realized how stupid he had been .	1
he searched the air again until he located the spot .	1
it took twice as long to find it again .	1
this time he used both hands and tried to enlarge the opening .	1
there was nothing he could see , he had to work by touch only and his muscles strained to gain some kind of advantage over the rip .	1
it wanted to close back up around his fingers , but slowly he widened it enough to poke his elbow through and get more leverage .	1
tommy had started at chest level , but now the hole seemed to be higher up .	1
with his elbow thrust through he tried to force the hole down , but although it was widening , it was also pulling him upwards .	1
he kicked up off the ground and plunged his head and chest through .	1
a stranger sight was never seen for on the doldale side hung a boys torso and legs , kicking wildly , while on the luruss side tommys hands had found a round hairy object that was letting out screams and yelps of utter fear .	1
it was dark , pitch black , blind , and tommy screamed , too , trying to winch his way back from where he had come .	1
but at that moment the other screams stopped and noelle grabbed his arms and pulled .	1
chapter 1 new friends tommy mcarthur and his little brother billy would usually spend a month at his grandparents place each summer .	1
grandma and grandpa gustafson allowed them to bring their pet dog , noodle , along .	1
grandma said a dachshund wasnt much trouble and that was true for noodle who hardly ever , ever barked .	1
billy and tommy , on the other hand , could be big trouble .	1
they didnt usually play together at home since they were more than four years apart , but at grandma and grandpas they didnt have anyone else to play with so they tended to do everything together .	1
of course that led to trouble , which led to fights , which led to yelling and , for billy , crying .	1
this year , though , grandpa gustafson had promised to take each boy camping alone for a week if they could promise to behave .	1
it was the first saturday in july when they arrived at the big old steep roofed house that grandpa gustafsons father had built sixty or seventy years ago .	1
maffett street was a beautiful tree-lined street where most of the houses were white , two-story homes with front porches and detached garages out back .	1
there was an alley that ran behind the houses where the garbage cans sat and you could pull your car into your garage from the back and drive right on through if you wanted to .	1
along side of the garage grandma had planted a patch of tomatoes and beans and cucumbers .	1
the earth smelled wonderful there and tommy liked to sit in one of the big white wooden chairs , there were two of them , and watch her weed the garden .	1
he wasnt afraid that shed ask him to help .	1
she had asked for his assistance when he was billys age and he had pulled up half of the vegetables instead of the weeds before grandma noticed .	1
she just laughed , though , and replanted them , but she never asked him to help again .	1
now , while their mom and dad were putting their bicycles in the garage , tommy and his brother were lugging their suitcases up the front steps and into the tiny foyer .	1
their rooms were straight up the stairs and tommy didnt hesitate .	1
he always claimed the larger room , first come first served , hed tell billy .	1
his room , on the right , had another door behind a drape that let you walk right into the attic .	1
the treasures there were fascinating , but it got so hot in that space that he had to remember to explore first thing in the morning before the sun did its work .	1
billy hadnt discovered the attic yet and tommy wasnt about to tip him off .	1
the room on the left was billys and he would complain that he always got the smaller room , but really he didnt mind .	1
he thought that this room was special .	1
the laundry chute was in his closet and he could shout down to grandma in the kitchen or grandpa way down in the basement where his workshop was .	1
grandmas laundry room was down there , too , as well as what the boys considered a playroom .	1
it was a room of extra furniture and keepsakes , books , games , and toys .	1
the boys settled in quickly and joined their parents and grandparents in the kitchen for a large luncheon and about an hour of conversation before their parents left .	1
mind your grandma and grandpa , boys , their mother said as usual , and remember not to run past the big clock in the living room .	1
she always said that whenever they visited as if they needed even another reminder .	1
tommy waved goodbye until their car was out of sight then asked for permission to walk to the drug store .	1
it was only three blocks away and no busy streets to cross .	1
he was allowed to go alone , but he usually had to drag billy along .	1
if he were lucky billy would already be into the toys in the basement and not want to go .	1
he got his wish when he went inside to get his money .	1
he could actually hear billy rummaging through the stuff in the playroom .	1
he darted up the stairs and got the first of several five-dollar bills he had brought .	1
he planned to spend the money on candy .	1
grandma thought he would buy books .	1
even comic books , she said , were good purchases .	1
she encouraged him to read a lot and he did , probably more than any of his friends back home who were undoubtedly spending the summer practicing and playing soccer .	1
tommy loved soccer and played on a spring team and an indoor winter team , but his parents declared that summer was for reading , relaxing , and resting , the three rs , and besides he would miss too many games the month he spent at his grandparents .	1
oh , well , what grandma didnt know was there was a stash of comic books and old classics in the attic that had been his mothers .	1
he would buy candy at the drug store and get a book from the attic to read on the back porch .	1
this was his plan and it seemed to be the best use of his allowance , at least it seemed that way to him .	1
he put the bill in his pocket and pushed aside the drape that hid the attic door .	1
a wall of hot air greeted him as he entered .	1
he could hardly breathe the dry heat .	1
it seemed to cover him from head to toe like a suffocating wool blanket .	1
he rushed to the old train trunk and opened it .	1
he had restacked the books last summer so the ones he hadnt read would be on top .	1
he grabbed the top two , a book and a comic book , closed the trunk and hurried out , careful to close the door quietly .	1
the stairway in this old house was narrower and steeper than most and he had taught billy to slide down the treads on his rump .	1
tommy could do it so expertly that billy had taken to calling him waxy butt or ski rump .	1
tommy sat on the top step and began the bumpity ride .	1
he was half way down when he stopped , deciding that he had finally outgrown this little trick .	1
he took the last six steps two at a time and raced through the living room , slowing down a little as he passed the big old grandfather clock , then he cut through the dining room , went into the kitchen , and out the back door onto the porch .	1
he hid the books under the metal lounge chair in the corner of the screened-in porch then burst out the screen door .	1
be careful crossing the street , his grandmother hollered from the garden .	1
he could see his grandfather tinkering with something in the garage while noodle sniffed around the corners and he waved before turning down the driveway and out to the sidewalk .	1
too bad there arent any kids on this block , he mused .	1
he noticed a for sale sign on the house across the street .	1
it would be nice if a boy his age moved in there by next summer .	1
suddenly he tripped on a couple of large stones in the middle of the sidewalk .	1
he looked down and saw chalk marks , the beginnings of that stupid hopscotch game that girls played .	1
he wasnt interested in playing with girls , though he did glance up at the house next door .	1
the large front porch had two bikes sitting side by side on it .	1
there was a small doll carriage , too .	1
oh , no , girls .	1
he vaguely remembered meeting some little girls who were visiting there years and years ago .	1
he looked away and concentrated on checking each and every house he passed for signs of male inhabitants .	1
he crossed the street and turned the corner .	1
he reached the corner drugstore in no time and pushed through the heavy glass door .	1
the candy aisle was two aisles over and he made a beeline straight for the candy bars .	1
this would take a bit of thought ; he might even spend ten or fifteen minutes contemplating just the right combination of flavors .	1
first he picked out a few of the large chocolate bars , then some tart candies , followed by licorice and gum .	1
he did the arithmetic in his head and knew he had just enough left for one more thing : bribe candy .	1
he always kept a box of something that billy liked so he could dole out one candy at a time to get billy to do things for him , like get out of his room , like not tell on him , like do him a favor .	1
sometimes , though , he had to resort to threatening billy with a little pounding on the arm .	1
tommy suspected that fighting was going to be more common as they got older .	1
he had noticed how his dad and his uncles still threw a few punches at each other .	1
playfully , they said .	1
anyway , tommy would start with bribe candy for now ; he didnt think his grandma appreciated any roughhousing .	1
he paid for his purchases and left the drug store with a weighty bag of sugary delights .	1
he leaned against the side of the building and peered into the bag .	1
what to start with ?	1
he opened the box of sweet and tart candies and popped a purple one into his mouth .	1
he listened to the sounds of summer : birds , traffic , a plane up above , and , somewhere , the sound of kids laughing .	1
probably little kids , he thought , or girls .	1
he headed back to his grandparents house , but stopped as he rounded the last corner and saw his little brother playing in the neighbors yard .	1
billy had short brown hair in a crew cut just like tommy , but not now he was wearing a curly red wig and had an apron tied around his waist .	1
he was leaning over a dolls baby carriage and pushing down on something .	1
a little girl about the same size as billy was standing on the other side of the carriage with her hands busy working on whatever was in the carriage .	1
they laughed again and tommy recognized it as the sound he had heard a block away .	1
what was his little brother doing ?	1
he was acting like a girl .	1
this had to stop and it had to stop right now .	1
tommy marched purposefully up to the yard and stood on the sidewalk with his hands on his hips , candy bag dangling down .	1
billy , he startled them , what are you doing ?	1
hi , tommy , look , billy lifted his hands and up jumped a large black cat from the carriage .	1
the little girl grabbed at it and pushed it back down .	1
the poor thing was wearing a baby bonnet and a diaper and was meowing frantically .	1
were playing house , billy announced .	1
this is tracy , shes nine , and her sister , noelle , is your age .	1
billy jerked his head toward the front porch indicating a pretty blonde girl who was sitting on the floor of the porch between the bikes .	1
tommy was momentarily stunned .	1
he wasnt shy around girls , he had lots of friends at school that were girls , but he just wasnt aware that she was sitting there watching him .	1
it took him a moment to change from the accusing older brother act to a friendlier greeting .	1
hi , tommy said .	1
both sisters answered at the same time .	1
tommy changed his tone and asked his question again as noelle came down from the porch .	1
whatcha doin ?	1
billy was quick to explain how tracy would use her cat as a real baby and once they got it calmed down they could push the stroller up and down the sidewalk .	1
whats with the wig ?	1
tommy asked .	1
oh !	1
billy tore it off his head and handed it back to tracy .	1
its hers .	1
we er i was just keeping it out of the way while she fixed the cat .	1
his name is boots .	1
hes almost bigger than noodle , but that probably wont stop noodle from chasing him , tommy said .	1
billy answered , he did .	1
noodle did chase boots .	1
i put him in the back porch , though , and then i helped tracy get boots out of the tree .	1
noelle joined them and asked tommy if he wanted to go bike riding with her .	1
why not ?	1
he thought .	1
ill just put this in my room , he said , indicating the bag of candy .	1
she nodded and tommy took off at a run for the back of the house .	1
grandma was still in the garden and he told her his plans then he went in through the back porch and was greeted by a very slobbery noodle and the sound of the big clock in the living room .	1
it was just chiming the first of the four notes it always rang on the quarter hour .	1
tommy was going to leave his bag under the chair with the books , but noodle would sniff it out in a microsecond .	1
better hide it up high in his bedroom closet .	1
first he fished out the gum and put two packs in his pocket .	1
then he headed toward the kitchen .	1
in his hurry he raced through the old house not bothering to slow down as he passed the large old grandfather clock .	1
his left foot landed hard right in front of the old timepiece and the door to the pendulum box swung out .	1
tommy had a sudden fear that the whole thing was going to topple over on him and he dropped the bag of candy and reached for the door to push it back closed again .	1
he must have slammed it too hard because the clock wobbled and rang once more , then the pendulum ticked when it should have tocked and tommy slipped through a hole in the floor and landed with a thud in the basement .	1
chapter 2 not the basement !	1
only it wasnt the basement .	1
tommy had fallen on his butt as soon as his feet hit the ground .	1
soft ground , luckily .	1
there was clumpy grass under him and his heels were resting on a rock .	1
but the rock was spongy .	1
that was weird .	1
it looked like a rock but it felt like a pillow .	1
maybe this was all a dream , he thought .	1
he pinched himself and it hurt .	1
he looked all around and everything was clear as day .	1
this definitely was not a dream .	1
he stood up and felt a little dizzy so he leaned over and rested his hands on his knees .	1
he blinked his eyes several times and just stared at the ground .	1
little blue ants were scurrying every which way around the soft rock .	1
then he realized that the clump of grass he had been sitting on was also an interesting shade of blue , like the color of noelles eyes .	1
then he laughed at himself for thinking such a silly thought .	1
he straightened up again and the dizziness was gone .	1
he had the strange feeling that he had been here before and he knew the way home .	1
it was just over that hill .	1
the hill that boasted two very tall blue spruce trees .	1
very tall .	1
very blue .	1
now that he really looked around he saw that all the trees were blue .	1
blue leaves on every branch .	1
tommy should have been scared , but this place felt comfortable .	1
he started up the path toward the spruce trees but stopped when he neared the top .	1
he could hear voices .	1
just to be on the safe side he decided to step off the path and hide behind the tree .	1
the voices sounded friendly but you never knew .	1
tommy peered around the blue branches and watched .	1
step lightly , miss gwinn , said a tall red-haired man as he passed a pretty young woman .	1
step lightly , mr. zerd , she responded .	1
tommy frowned at the greetings , wondering what had happened to the traditional good morning or good afternoon .	1
neither of the two people headed his way .	1
miss gwinn went right toward a two-story building while mr. zerd went left toward a pen holding several pink sheep .	1
at least tommy thought they were sheep , the sounds they were making sounded less like bleating and more like meowing .	1
this was a most interesting place , tommy thought , as he noticed two more people coming from behind the building .	1
he heard the same greetings but then they lowered their voices and spoke in whispers .	1
one of them pointed toward tommys hideout and the other two looked quickly .	1
then miss gwinn went inside the building , but not before telling her friends to step lightly as if that were a goodbye .	1
if they were aware of him maybe he should step out into the open , he thought , then decided against that .	1
he turned and headed back down the hill and then took the path in the opposite direction .	1
it wound around several blue trees and into a forest of blue .	1
there were several rocks littering the path , but every one that he stepped on was soft and springy .	1
he began bouncing his way along from rock to rock .	1
suddenly a voice stopped him cold .	1
step lightly there , young man !	1
the tall mr. zerd stood before him holding a pink sheep on a leash .	1
the marns wont take kindly to your stepping on the backs of all their young .	1
tommy could see the man was concerned but not quite angry with him .	1
the marns ?	1
tommy asked .	1
oh , youre a visitor , arent you ?	1
he said the word visitor with more stress on the last syllable : visitor .	1
the marns are the soft rocks .	1
theyre very sensitive .	1
tommy looked down at the path then back at the man and the animal .	1
dont step on them , visitor .	1
always take the left fork and pay for what you eat .	1
mr. zerd reached down to his sheep and grabbed a handful of the pink wool .	1
he stretched his hand out in an offering of the pink stuff and tommy didnt know what he should do .	1
gingerly he reached his own hand out palm up and mr. zerd deposited the fluffy stuff in the middle .	1
tommy stared at it and mr. zerd could see he was confused so he put his own two hands around tommys and squeezed the pink wool into his fist .	1
when tommy opened his hand he was surprised to find a hard round pink coin .	1
mr. zerd abruptly turned and spoke over his shoulder , step lightly .	1
tommy said , thank you , and then more softly , step lightly , you too .	1
he watched the man and sheep go back up the right fork of the trail .	1
the sheep was meowing as it followed .	1
it , too , was stepping lightly around the marns .	1
tommy turned the coin over in his hand and held it up closer to his eyes .	1
there was an inscription that made no sense to him .	1
he could only make out the last three words : land of doldale .	1
so , im in doldale , he thought , and i have to keep taking the left fork , stay off the marns , pay for what i eat , and eventually ill get back to grandmas , cuz here im just a visitor .	1
he chuckled to himself and took off down the left trail .	1
he walked for what seemed like hours and hours , miles and miles , without seeing another human being or animal .	1
his stomach started to growl and he thought of the gum in his pocket .	1
it might help to chew , he thought , but he would have preferred a sandwich or the dinner that he knew his grandmother was probably making right now .	1
he unwrapped a stick and rolled it into a ball before putting it into his mouth .	1
he crumpled the wrapper and tossed it away .	1
suddenly there was a loud roar and a huge lion-like creature appeared from behind a large marn .	1
its head had the typical lions mane , but the body was fat and pig-like with a curly short tail .	1
the mane was white and framed a very dark brown face while the body and tail were a gray tone .	1
tommy stood frozen to the spot as the beast sniffed at the gum wrapper and intermittently roared .	1
maybe the penalty for littering in doldale was death .	1
tommy finally got the feeling back in his legs and he started to run back the way he had come .	1
the roars of the lion behind him grew fainter and tommy dared to glance back to see that he was not being followed .	1
there was a group of marns ahead that looked like boulders .	1
he was breathing heavily and getting a stitch in his side that ached .	1
as he slowed his pace he headed toward the marns intending to sit down on one and rest .	1
it was very comfortable sitting on a large marn .	1
quite soft and , he noticed , there was a sweet scent wafting upwards .	1
if he wasnt so hungry he could imagine himself taking a nap on one of these soft creatures .	1
he heard a burbly sound and smelled more of the aroma .	1
he breathed it in deeply .	1
it smelled like nothing in particular but everything in general : grandmas garden , moms perfume , dads cologne , apple pie , fresh cookies , flowers , the meadow , cinnamon pancakes .	1
it was making his stomach growl more but his eyes grew heavy .	1
the scent was drugging him and he put his head down on the next marn and stretched between them .	1
it was an odd yet comfortable bed and the second marn began to softly burble as well .	1
more aromas arose : hot chocolate , fudge , popcorn , roses , tangerines .	1
tommy sank deeper into the marns and closed his eyes .	1
he mouth fell open and the gum slipped out .	1
he slept hard .	1
chapter 3 step lightly ! boy !	1
tommy awoke with a start from the hard ground .	1
what did you do ?	1
angrily a woman scolded him .	1
get off the marns !	1
theyre almost dead !	1
why , theyre flatter than a doldale coin .	1
what were you thinking ?	1
step lightly , now .	1
she was fat and sweaty , with her face all scrunched up and puckered like a prune and she was stomping the ground with a thick walking stick .	1
tommy rolled off the flattened marns onto his hands and knees and the coin he had in his pocket fell at his fingertips .	1
the old womans eyes fixed on the pink coin and her face changed into a near approximation of a smile .	1
a pink .	1
you have a pink , i see .	1
are you a visitor ?	1
she pronounced it just like zerd .	1
tommy got up and nodded .	1
are you hungry ?	1
ill give you a whole dinner for that pink coin .	1
a whole dinner and two blue coins in change .	1
tommy had no idea what a pink or a blue coin was worth , but he sure was hungry and dinner sounded great .	1
he passed over the pink coin and the old woman gave him two blue coins from her pocket .	1
then she cracked off the rounded top of the walking stick and bit into it as she shoved the rest of the stick in tommy face .	1
there you go , boy .	1
enjoy and step lightly , she said as she chewed noisily , crunching on another bit of the piece .	1
she mumbled under her breath , cant have a visitor eating the best part .	1
wait a minute , tommy began , but the old woman was fast .	1
she jumped over a marn at the side of the trail , bent down and grabbed a handful of the blue grass , then disappeared behind a humongous tree trunk .	1
tommy was stunned .	1
he had just bought a walking stick for dinner .	1
he looked at it .	1
it appeared to be a giant pretzel .	1
the top part where she had broken off the rounded head was flaky and warm .	1
he smelled the top .	1
hot pretzel .	1
he bit off a tiny portion and rolled it around on his tongue before chewing it up .	1
yum .	1
he broke off a bigger piece and stuffed it into his watering mouth .	1
delicious .	1
this wasnt a bad deal after all .	1
and he had two blue coins left .	1
perhaps zerd and the old woman were nice , generous citizens of doldale .	1
he looked around for a place to sit and eat .	1
the flattened marns were starting to puff back up ; he hadnt killed them after all , but maybe he shouldnt stick around here .	1
there was that lion to worry about up the trail and apparently the marns had parents that could crush him .	1
he didnt want to go back down the trail and walk hours and hours back to where zerd and gwinn were .	1
he stood and ate and thought .	1
the walking stick was changing flavors now .	1
the center was meaty and juicy and a bit salty .	1
tommy was just beginning to worry about getting thirsty when he broke off a piece and saw that the hollow center was filled with liquid .	1
he drank down the cool refreshing fluid in mighty gulps , following it with a satisfied belch .	1
the bottom of the stick was dessert , sort of like a peach cobbler with a crunchy sugary crust .	1
not bad .	1
as he ate he made a decision to follow the old woman and not stick to the trail .	1
though zerd had told him to always take the left fork he didnt think that was possible with the lion up the way .	1
maybe the old woman would help him if he gave her back the blue coins .	1
he stepped over the marn and followed the crushed blue grass that marked the old womans steps .	1
he noticed where she had pulled up a handful of blades and wondered why she had done that .	1
then he moved around the giant tree and stepped in front of a welcome mat .	1
a likeness of the old womans face was embroidered on it in the middle .	1
above it said lorlynn and below in fancy script was written step lightly .	1
there was a door on the tree with a glass window .	1
he put one foot on the mat and reached forward about to knock .	1
as he put his second foot on the mat he began to descend , his outstretched hand scraping the knuckles on the bark .	1
then before he could jump off there was a sudden swhoosh sound and the welcome mat/elevator landed ten feet below and he fell down at the feet of the old woman .	1
how rude , boy !	1
dont you know to knock before you enter ?	1
terkling visitor .	1
she mumbled that last part under her breath , obviously cursing him .	1
im sorry , tommy stuttered , i just wanted to ask you for help .	1
he stood up and as he did the welcome mat shot upwards .	1
help ?	1
what kind of help ?	1
youve already done your sleeping , and on the marns , too .	1
and youve eaten your dinner , i see .	1
so what could i do for you ?	1
im busy , visitor , i have to make another dinner .	1
she turned away from him and took two steps to a large cauldron that was tipped on its side .	1
tommy could see it was full of blue grass and there was half a walking stick being used as a stirring spoon .	1
the old woman , lorlynn , grabbed the end of the stick and made two stirs in one direction and two more in the other .	1
the stick grew longer .	1
i just want to get home .	1
how do the other visitors , i mean visitors , get home ?	1
tommy slumped his shoulders and tried to look pathetic , hoping she would take pity on him .	1
please , miss lorlynn , please help me .	1
i cant show you or well both be in the dungeon .	1
better you ask mr. zerd .	1
she turned her back again and stirred some more .	1
mr. zerd told me to always take the left fork and pay for what i eat .	1
he gave me the pink coin that said doldale that i used to pay for the dinner you gave me .	1
but i cant take the left fork because theres a lion or some kind of beast up that way .	1
he paused for breath but lorlynn answered .	1
if youve already talked to zerd then you know all you have to know .	1
i dont know what a lion is , but if theres some kind of beast on the left fork path , then it was left there by another visitor and it shouldnt do you any harm .	1
just ignore it .	1
now climb up the tree there and be gone , she nodded toward a series of rungs that ended at the door with the window .	1
and jump over the terkling mat , dont forget .	1
tommy started climbing and reached the door , which automatically opened .	1
he leaped over the mat and looked back as the door closed .	1
the old womans face was in the window smiling .	1
how did she climb up so fast ?	1
tommy smiled and waved and lorlynns face disappeared .	1
he went around the tree and found his way back to the path .	1
the marns he had slept on were puffed back up to their original size , but something was different .	1
a tree was growing between them now .	1
it hadnt been there before .	1
curiously tommy felt the bark and ran his hand up and down the trunk .	1
he reached up and put all his weight on a branch .	1
how could such a thing happen so quickly ?	1
time was all screwed up here .	1
the leaves of this incredible new tree were as blue as every other growing thing .	1
but as he looked up into the branches he could see pink rectangles scattered throughout .	1
they looked just like sticks of gum .	1
tommy remembered that he had been chewing gum before he fell asleep on the marns .	1
could this tree have grown from the one piece he had chewed ?	1
he jumped up and threw his leg up over the limb , nimbly climbing the new tree .	1
he reached for a stick of gum and smelled it before plunging it into his mouth .	1
yup .	1
it was gum , all right , the same flavor he had been chewing .	1
maybe he should drop his coins , he thought , and start a bank .	1
he dropped to the ground and started down the left fork .	1
tommy had gone just about as far as he thought he had gone before and he expected to encounter the lion at any moment .	1
he started to tiptoe just in case the beast was sleeping and he could pass unnoticed .	1
then he saw it .	1
it was sleeping ; in fact it was snoring loudly , under the shade of a new blue paper tree .	1
all the paper looked like gum wrappers .	1
it almost made sense , the gum tree , now the gum wrapper tree , but what about the lion ?	1
what had some visitor left to create such a monster ?	1
a stuffed animal ?	1
he kept creeping on , following the path , stepping lightly around the smallest of marns , chewing his gum , thinking and wondering .	1
what would happen next ?	1
chapter 4 marn rocks & crysta-lins the path ended abruptly at a wall of rock .	1
there was no going left or right around the mammoth rock without leaving the safety of the path .	1
there were boulder-sized marns everywhere and he didnt dare step on those .	1
he would have to climb up and have a look around .	1
this couldnt be the parent marn , tommy hoped , as he started to climb .	1
it was hard and scratchy , but it was odd that it would just suddenly show up blocking his path .	1
he found another foothold and heaved himself higher up onto a ledge .	1
he looked back down at the blue landscape below and thought how fuzzy the things in the distance seemed .	1
maybe he needed glasses ; he had been squinting a lot at the blackboard last year .	1
he climbed straight up and came to a flat top that was somewhat spongy to walk on .	1
he reached down and pressed his fingers into the rock .	1
it was as soft as the small marns he had stepped on when he first arrived in this strange land .	1
the rock began to vibrate and tommy lost his balance .	1
he tumbled forward just as the rock , or perhaps mother marn , started to roll down the path .	1
at first he leaped up and started walking upright just to stay on the top , but then he realized that the marn was gathering speed and was going in the direction he had just come from .	1
he quickly scrambled forward and down the backside .	1
it was as hard as going down the up escalator back at the mall .	1
he kicked off and landed with a thud on the path right about where he had first been blocked by the giant marn , but now the marn was behind him .	1
tommy hurried along , stepping lightly of course , and glancing back from time to time to be sure the angry rock wasnt rolling this way to crush him .	1
the two blue coins jingle-jangled in his pocket and kept rhythm to his speed .	1
the smaller marns in his way seemed to be spaced in such a way that he had to hop and skip in patterns .	1
it became a game and he got better and faster , but he was not paying attention to anything around him other than the trail .	1
a peal of thunder clapped loudly nearby followed by three more bangs .	1
tommy watched for lightning , but there was not a cloud in the sky .	1
strangely the sky was turning from a normal blue to a sunset of greens .	1
there were all shades of green , but none of the usual sunset colors .	1
he thought again of the crashing sound of what he had assumed was thunder .	1
when he replayed it in his mind it reminded him of the grandfather clock he wasnt supposed to run past .	1
four dongs close together ; it must be quarter after something .	1
the path was sloping downwards now and the going was easier as there were fewer and fewer marns to avoid .	1
the green sunset spread before him like a picture and he could see the outline of a cityscape beneath the bottom shades of green .	1
but the path was veering to the right and would soon disappear into a forest of blue .	1
tommy was hesitant to enter the darkening woods , but since he had no better option he continued on .	1
the forest immediately enveloped him , not only with sights and sounds , but also with strange smells .	1
bad smells , skunky smells , burnt rubber smells , ashtray smells .	1
the sounds were better : songbirds and owls .	1
the sights were strange .	1
each tree was twisted and grew in unexpected directions .	1
he sometimes had to crawl or climb over and under limbs in the way of the trail .	1
the skunky smell pursued him and seemed to grow stronger in his nostrils until he thought he would burst from the stink .	1
he breathed through his mouth and found that he could taste the stench .	1
chewing his gum faster didnt help .	1
the trail grew narrower and harder to follow because of the trees .	1
ahead of him he saw a flock of small birds darting from tree to tree singing madly .	1
an owl flew straight at him and nipped his ear .	1
he burst threw the tangled branches of a blue spruce and scattered the songbirds .	1
when he did tommy was stunned to find that the path split into two sets of forks .	1
there was a sign between the two right paths that said : luruss , 1,388 steps .	1
the sign between the two left paths said : doldale , 1,979 steps .	1
it wasnt a hard decision for tommy ; he chose the far left path to doldale .	1
only one thousand nine hundred seventy nine steps and maybe he could get out of here .	1
with the dark blue forest behind him and the green sunset once again in front of him he knew he had to hurry to make it before dark .	1
he spit out his gum and started counting his steps out loud , running a little , half jogging .	1
there was not a single marn to get in his way , but he kept his eyes on the path not looking up at all until something bopped him in the head .	1
he stopped short and was hit again from behind .	1
as if suspended from golden threads , there were large diamond-shaped crystals floating in the air above his head and in front of him across the trail .	1
a small silver sign at the side of the path warned of this latest phenomenon .	1
beware the crysta-lins .	1
breathe heavy or stay in doldale .	1
tommy pondered the message .	1
obviously these beautiful objects were crysta-lins , but since the sign said to beware of them they might be dangerous or poisonous or something .	1
he felt his forehead where the first one smacked him .	1
he wasnt bleeding but there was a bump there and it itched .	1
the back of his head also sported a lump and he scratched around the spot .	1
they felt like giant mosquito bites .	1
what could the sign mean ?	1
breathe heavy ?	1
he blew at the first crysta-lin and it withered before his eyes .	1
he heard a pathetic cry and he instantly felt sorry .	1
the beautiful object puddled at his feet and melted .	1
then two more , much larger , crysta-lins blocked his way .	1
he pushed them aside with his hands and moved forward a few steps .	1
his hands began to itch dreadfully .	1
more crysta-lins of all sizes , very beautiful and sparkly , hovered around him .	1
he had no choice but to breathe heavily on each one watching them drop and disintegrate sadly into the ground .	1
he continued on in this way until he was quite light headed from all the huffing and puffing and he feared he would pass out before he reached doldale .	1
he had lost track of the number of steps he had taken but surely it was over a thousand as the city seemed twice as close as before .	1
he was elated when abruptly there were no more crysta-lins to block his way , however , a gate closed the path from further progress .	1
pay the toll , visitor !	1
screamed a childlike man from behind the gate .	1
pay the toll !	1
how much do you have ?	1
two blue coins , tommy obediently answered .	1
the man looked harmless enough .	1
are they doldale or luruss ?	1
he demanded .	1
tommy didnt have the slightest idea .	1
he emptied his pocket and held the blue coins up to the fading light .	1
he assumed they must be doldale coins but he could just make out the letters l , u , and r. i guess theyre luruss , he answered .	1
the small mans eyes gleamed , toss them over .	1
tommy did and the little man ate them like candy then screamed even louder , not allowed !	1
no luruss coins allowed here !	1
to the dungeon with you !	1
he pulled a lever by the gate before tommy had a chance to react and the ground opened up and for the second time tommy dropped down , down .	1
chapter 5 the dungeon the dungeon was dark , naturally , although there were fiery torches on each of the four walls that illuminated the cave-like room .	1
tommy hit the hard ground faster than he had a chance to even scream a word of surprise .	1
he needed a moment to process this new experience so he sat dumbfounded for a few minutes .	1
he had been astonished to see the little man eat the coins .	1
why would he do that ?	1
and if luruss coins werent allowed here why had the old woman given them to him ?	1
he thought he knew .	1
he was a visitor and he could be tricked .	1
well , he thought , he had gotten himself out of every other predicament here ; he would just have to figure his way out of this problem , too .	1
he rose up and took the torch from the closest wall .	1
he held the flame close to the floor , the wall , the ceiling , then moved around and slowly examined his prison .	1
when he had thought he had made a complete circle he realized that there were still four torches on the walls plus the one he had in his hand .	1
he couldnt be sure that he had checked all the walls .	1
they seemed identical .	1
he removed another torch and stood staring at the empty wooden torch holder half expecting another torch to magically appear .	1
nothing happened .	1
with a burning torch in each hand he made the circuit again , glancing back at the empty holder from time to time to keep his perspective .	1
but instead of examining four walls he found that there were five walls this time and the room was much larger though there was still no door , no window , no hole , no escape .	1
tommy decided he had made a mistake the first time .	1
the dungeon couldnt have grown .	1
he glanced back toward the empty torch holder , but another flaming torch was burning there .	1
he shook his head and counted all the torches along the walls .	1
now there were six plus the two in his hands .	1
the room was larger yet , but no brighter even with the extra torches .	1
he wondered just how big he could make this place .	1
he set the two torches down in the middle of the area and ran from wall to wall collecting and pitching the flaming sticks into the center .	1
he counted as he circled the great room .	1
eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve .	1
the pile in the center was beginning to grow larger than any bonfire he had seen at camp .	1
thirteen , fourteen , fifteen .	1
he was getting tired and running out of breath .	1
sixteen , seventeen .	1
so much fire now and smoke , too .	1
he couldnt throw the torches all the way to the middle anymore ; it was too far .	1
tommy stood at torch number eighteen and looked .	1
what once had been a small square room was now huge and almost round .	1
flames from the far opposite walls looked like matches .	1
tommy rested his hand on the base of the eighteenth torch , but didnt lift it up out of the holder .	1
i wish i hadnt done that , he mumbled aloud .	1
whos there ?	1
someone demanded .	1
tommy stiffened .	1
his eyes searched the dimness madly , but there were only flame shadows .	1
just me .	1
whos me ?	1
where are you ?	1
the voice softened .	1
it sounded like another boy his own age .	1
im tommy .	1
tommy mcarthur .	1
im in the dungeon .	1
oh , the dungeon .	1
well , why are you there ?	1
what did you do ?	1
tommy felt silly talking to thin air but he replied just the same , i tried to pay the toll at the gate with two blue coins , luruss coins , that werent allowed .	1
the gate keeper pulled a lever and sent me here .	1
oh , are you from luruss ?	1
no , im not from anywhere around here .	1
i kept taking the left fork trying to get back home somehow , but stuff keeps happening .	1
the left fork , you say ?	1
are you a visitor ?	1
tommy didnt want to lie though he wasnt sure telling the truth would help him .	1
he hesitated then decided on the truth .	1
yes , i am .	1
then i want to meet you .	1
come out of the dungeon at once , the young voice ordered .	1
but how ?	1
thats easy .	1
blow out one torch and theyll all go out .	1
thats silly , tommy thought , but he obeyed anyway and took a deep breath .	1
the eighteenth torch withered and faded as he blew , as did all the rest of the torches .	1
in an instant the dungeon went black .	1
open your eyes , visitor .	1
tommy did and found himself in a lavish palace chamber .	1
he was standing as he had been in the dungeon , only his hand now rested on a lovely glass sconce that shed a pink light about the room .	1
he could hardly take it in .	1
the furniture was plentiful and luxurious .	1
the floor was covered with furs and on the walls hung tapestries and great paintings .	1
the high ceiling was golden with beams the size of oak trees .	1
a voice behind him made him jerk his head around .	1
there !	1
you see .	1
youre out of the dungeon .	1
and even i cant send you back .	1
well , i could , but now you know how to get out so , well , uh .	1
.	1
.	1
the two boys stared at each other .	1
they were opposites .	1
tommy was thin .	1
the other boy was stocky .	1
tommy had short , short hair .	1
the other boys hair was long and curly , down to his shoulders .	1
for an instant tommy was confused .	1
the voice had sounded male , but the long curls shouted female .	1
he had to at least ask for a name .	1
hi , like i said , im tommy .	1
whats your name ?	1
i am hackley , prince of doldale .	1
he swept a large feathered hat off his head and bowed deeply .	1
tommy wanted to laugh as the princes curls dangled over his face .	1
the whole gesture , the look , the hat , everything reminded tommy of the three musketeers .	1
but tommy politely bowed , too , and said , pleased to meet you .	1
the prince waited expectantly then prompted , well , do you have a gift for me ?	1
tommy thought quickly then pulled a package of gum out of his pocket .	1
this is for you , prince hackley .	1
the prince frowned at such a small and simply wrapped gift .	1
then he brightened , what is it ?	1
is it magic ?	1
tommy explained about gum then added as an afterthought , it is a type of magic in that you can chew it for just about forever .	1
try one .	1
the prince gently drew out a stick and pulled the wrapper off .	1
he sniffed it a bit and licked one side before setting it on his tongue .	1
finally he started to chew .	1
he seemed pleased and tommy relaxed .	1
you can blow bubbles with it and make a loud popping sound , too .	1
that really annoys teachers , tommy added .	1
what are teachers ?	1
the prince asked .	1
teachers , you know , the grown-ups who teach you stuff .	1
at school , tommy answered .	1
school ?	1
the prince echoed .	1
what is school ?	1
oh , man , tommy looked admiringly at the young prince , you probably dont have to go to school .	1
you probably have tutors to teach you stuff like history , geography , english , and math .	1
oh , and science .	1
the prince chewed slowly on the gum and eyed tommy suspiciously .	1
i dont know many of these words youre using .	1
answer my question .	1
what is school ?	1
tommy thought a moment then gave the most basic explanation he could think of , starting with the building itself , the classrooms , the kids , and each subject .	1
as he gave more and more details the prince sat down on a large round ottoman and gestured to tommy to sit on the fur on the floor .	1
prince hackley asked for more particulars and tommy felt obligated to enlighten him on the finer points of a public education , like recess , art , music , and gym .	1
it took quite a while and tommy hadnt even properly thanked him for releasing him from the dungeon yet .	1
this is fascinating , the prince proclaimed .	1
i shall have to ask my father to institute a school for all the people in doldale , young and old .	1
you might not be too popular after a while , tommy warned , only girls like school .	1
for a moment he was afraid that the prince was going to ask him what a girl was , but the princes strange look was not about that .	1
my jaws are tired , prince hackley announced .	1
he took the gum from his mouth and stared at the glob .	1
can i save it for later ?	1
yeah , but itll get hard .	1
just throw it away and get a new one .	1
to tommys surprise the prince threw the gum straight over his head toward a wall where it smacked onto a colorful tapestry and stuck .	1
tommy thought to himself that he would have to be more careful of what he said .	1
prince hackley , tommy began again , id really like to thank you for getting me out of that dungeon .	1
will you tell me how to get home ?	1
the prince shook his curls and got up from the ottoman .	1
visitors always take the left fork .	1
its as easy as that .	1
hackley looked down at tommy and asked , do you ride ?	1
yeah .	1
tommy assumed he meant bikes .	1
come with me .	1
i have a new zeebian and you can ride my old one .	1
tommy didnt protest and followed the prince out of the lovely room and through one hallway and down another , past several large sitting rooms and through what must have been a ballroom .	1
then they stepped outside into a pink and blue garden .	1
a winding path took them past several strange fountains that looked like prehistoric animals spitting up .	1
tommy kept close behind the prince while still trying to take in all of his surroundings .	1
the palace grounds were like none he had ever read about or imagined .	1
just ignore the williants , the prince said .	1
dont even answer their stupid questions .	1
tommy had no idea what he was talking about .	1
williants ?	1
questions ?	1
he neither heard nor saw anyone else , but he decided not to admit that to the prince .	1
soon they arrived at a round enclosure much like a rodeo ring .	1
though the dirt was like blue dust the rest of the scene seemed familiar .	1
a red barn , taller than most , stood at one end of the ring .	1
a very tall door was closed and barred .	1
at the other end of the ring was a gate that opened to a walled maze , only the beginning of which tommy could see .	1
the ring itself was enclosed with a very high fence , easily climbable by a boy such as tommy .	1
the prince was already three feet up and continuing .	1
tommy followed .	1
at the top both boys swung a leg over and balanced .	1
the prince removed his feathered hat and held it out at his side .	1
here , willie , take this hat and bring me two riding hats .	1
instantly the hat disappeared and tommy felt the rails wiggle as if someone were climbing down .	1
he braced himself against the jiggling and noticed a series of footprints appear and disappear in the blue dust below .	1
then the tall barn door opened , but only at the bottom , like a pet door .	1
a moment later the little door closed and tommy spotted the footprints returning .	1
again the rails moved and suddenly there were two strange , pointy hats in the princes hands .	1
he handed one to tommy and explained , queens orders .	1
we cant ride without these .	1
tommy took one and put it on .	1
he no longer expected to be riding bikes but expected maybe something in the category of horse .	1
okay , willie , let the zeebians out .	1
and with that the rails rattled again , the blue dust quaked as the tiny footprints hurried along toward the barn , then the whole tall door slowly opened and tommy had the surprise of his life .	1
you have finished reading the first 5 chapters of a tick in time .	1
this book is available in paperback and digital e-book format .	1

bigfoot day , ninja night chapter 1 pooped out yeah , im one of the cool kids .	1
but i dont think im cool .	1
really .	1
its just that all the other kids at jayno adams elementary school think so .	1
i guess its cause im tall .	1
kids call me morning as a nickname cause my initials are a.m. thats cool .	1
anyway , i hang with the cool kids .	1
like austin michaels , hes my best friend .	1
i tell people hes like a brother to me .	1
they always laugh .	1
and we play , i mean hang , with mostly cool girls like sydney lock .	1
and callie stone .	1
they are way cool .	1
but cool wont help you against bigfoot .	1
okay , i know you dont believe we saw bigfoot .	1
but we did .	1
this is what happened : it was saturday and we were having our annual school fair .	1
you know , bouncy house , face painting and the other usual stuff .	1
our school backs up to a humongous woods and that woods borders a marshland and another state forest .	1
so its like really wild and we used to climb over the fence at recess and dare each other to play hide-and-seek .	1
the fourth-grade teacher , mrs. buckley , caught us once and we missed a week of recess .	1
anyway , its spooky in there and my grandpa told me about hobos that used to sleep there .	1
i didnt know what a hobo was .	1
it was some dirty , stinky homeless man who would ride the trains for free and beg for food and then steal chickens and stuff from farmers .	1
i told austin and sydney and callie about the hobos and then i would yell , hobo !	1
and everybody would run for safety .	1
anyway , we were at the school fair and the four of us decided it was pretty lame and we headed for the fence intending to mess around in the woods a while .	1
sydney was the first one over and she took off running like a horse and yelling , not it !	1
then she stumbled and fell smack into something that was brown and gooey and smelled really , really bad .	1
the thing about sydney is you never see her not smiling .	1
this was probably like the first time i ever saw her without a grin on her face .	1
eeuuy , callie said when she reached her .	1
austin and i just stared and covered our mouths and noses .	1
sydney got up and looked around for some big leaves to wipe herself off with .	1
the leaves she used just crumbled and she ended up smearing the brown stuff on her shirt and legs even more .	1
callie handed her some wet wipes she kept in her back pocket .	1
you could always count on callie for a tissue or a bandaid or anything .	1
dont just stand there , morning , sydney said to me .	1
move .	1
i didnt get why she was telling me to move until i followed her eyes down to my feet and saw that i was standing on her cell phone .	1
i had ignored the wobbly feel of the hard object along with the equally wobbly feel of the larger rocks i had been balancing on .	1
sorry .	1
i picked it up and handed it over .	1
she checked and of course it didnt work .	1
our parents had this rule that at least one of us had to have a cell on us when we werent home .	1
no problem .	1
usually we all had them with us .	1
except at school .	1
jayno adams new principal was mean about it .	1
no cells phones at school !	1
it was just habit that we didnt bring them to school so i , for one , didnt even think of grabbing mine to come to the fair .	1
syd gave me a smile and was cool about the phone .	1
i mean , really , why get your panties in a bunch ?	1
the brown stuff that was drying on her legs was more panty-bunchable .	1
i really wanted to get my nose out of the whiff zone .	1
what do ya think that stuff is ?	1
austin was curious .	1
he kept staring at the enormous dung pile .	1
its more loose and puddly than dog doo .	1
there arent any cows in the woods , i dont think , so its not a cowpie .	1
what kind of animal leaves a turd that big and wet ?	1
austin was our resident expert on the types and colors of droppings .	1
i once saw him scrape white bird droppings off a fence post with his fingernail and sniff it .	1
he claimed he was making sure it wasnt bat poop .	1
like who cares ?	1
maybe its from bigfoot , callie offered .	1
shes probably the most timid and easily scared of the four of us .	1
this is where i should have made some growling , scary sound and gotten everybody freaked out and running back to the fair .	1
so i guess its my fault that instead of going back and having a normal day we went deeper into the woods .	1
its a quest !	1
sydney turned and started leaping over logs and ferns and leading us followers on .	1
lets find mr. bigfoot poopy pants .	1
i dont believe that girl .	1
most girls would have been horrified to have a soda spilled on their clothes let alone some you-know-what .	1
i couldnt imagine callie or me or austin in her place .	1
so , we followed her .	1
and let me tell you , we could have followed her blindfolded , just by smelling her .	1
it seemed like that stuff was getting stinkier as it dried .	1
i swear i could see lines of scent waving back from her like in a cartoon .	1
and here we go , off to find mr. bigfoot poopy pants .	1
brother !	1
if one of the not-cool kids had said that , well , we would have been rolling our eyes .	1
but sydneys funny .	1
i half smiled to myself , but then i frowned as it seemed like the forest got darker around us .	1
we all stopped at the same instant .	1
we couldnt believe our eyes !	1
chapter 2 back tracking what in heavens name is that ?	1
callie exclaimed .	1
shes really into church stuff and heaven comes up a lot .	1
thats cool .	1
its not poop .	1
austin was proud of his comment .	1
we circled around as if we were going to join hands and do some silly folk dance .	1
but we were all looking down at the gigantic , enormous , super-sized two-toed foot print that had smashed a dozen ant hills .	1
for once i didnt have anything to say .	1
sydney crouched down and stretched her hand across the imprint .	1
i think each toe was as big as her hand .	1
is this bigfoot ?	1
sydney whispered .	1
i wondered why she wasnt trembling cause i was .	1
no such thing , callie was shaking her head , my mom said so .	1
callies mom was like one of the smartest grown-ups any of us knew , smarter than our teachers , for sure .	1
no ants , austin stated .	1
i thought that was a little off the subject until he added , guess the ants havent had time to rebuild their little mounds .	1
guess that means mr. two-toes just made this footprint like a minute ago .	1
so then it was like everybody did that bobble-head thing with their necks as we all looked around in every direction .	1
something big , something not human , something with just two toes was out there in the darkening forest .	1
probably close by .	1
lets get outta here !	1
i said in a hoarse whisper .	1
i was first to move and i headed off in what i thought then was the opposite direction of mr. two-toes , based on the way the toes were pointing .	1
my fault again .	1
but how was i supposed to know that this creature , this humongous sasquatch , had been walking backwards ?	1
chapter 3 blood okay , so we were running in a straight line , jumping over logs and stuff and brushing spider webs out of our eyes .	1
i managed to stay in front .	1
longer legs , you know .	1
it wasnt that i was any more scared than anyone else .	1
wait , you guys !	1
callie was calling from the back of the pack .	1
hey , morning , slow up .	1
i cant run in these sandals .	1
i did a quick glance back .	1
austin was right on my heels with sydney a few feet behind him .	1
callie was lagging .	1
sandals or not , she had better put a move on , hustle , put the pedal to the metal , get the lead out .	1
oh my gosh , i was starting to sound like old mrs. buckley , the fourth grade teacher .	1
she was a font of knowledge , a treasure trove of information , a .	1
.	1
.	1
oh , there i go again .	1
morning !	1
stop !	1
i think were going the wrong way , callie was just trying to make me stop .	1
well , yeah .	1
i glanced back again and syd and austin had already halted and were doing that swivel-head thing again .	1
up and around , looking everywhere , eyes and heads moving in every direction at once .	1
so i stopped , too .	1
might as well .	1
no sense in me getting separated .	1
what makes you think were going in the wrong direction ?	1
i asked .	1
callie pointed up at the sky .	1
the sun .	1
now i know that callie gets good grades .	1
we all do .	1
but it just wasnt fair how she would know some stuff and could do some stuff that just didnt fit for kids our age .	1
like always know what time it was without a watch .	1
like know when the car was going north or east without looking at the compass on the dashboard .	1
like look at an outdoor photo in my moms family album and say what time of year it was taken because of the shadows ( and mom said she was right ) .	1
so when she said , the sun , i was instantly in agreement with her .	1
right .	1
okay .	1
which way should we go , callie ?	1
she spun around and pointed pretty much back the way we had just come .	1
but what about the monster ?	1
austin said .	1
yeah , the monster , sydney echoed .	1
callie simply shrugged her shoulders and reached down to tighten her left sandal .	1
okay !	1
i hollered .	1
i wasted absolutely no time at all in refocusing my single-minded quest for the way out of these woods .	1
again austin was right on my tail , in front of the girls .	1
ill have to teach him about manners sometime , you know , ladies first and all that , but for now it was everybody for himself .	1
sydney waited a bit for callie and then it was the four of us pounding through the underbrush .	1
it still seemed to be getting darker and the trees were taller and the ferns were thicker and the spiders were bigger and now the mosquitoes were buzzing our faces .	1
watch out , morning !	1
austin warned me , but it was too late .	1
i had been swatting frantically and i missed seeing the fallen branch across the trail .	1
my long legs took the impact in the middle of my shins and i went sprawling .	1
i was cool , though .	1
i did one of those tuck rolls we learned in gym and for the first time ever i sort of popped up like it was a planned acrobatic move .	1
must have been some natural ability i didnt know i had .	1
you okay ?	1
sydney bent lower and inspected my legs .	1
callie , more wipes .	1
she popped out two more wet wipes and i soaked up the blood that was running down my shin and into my shoe .	1
i tossed the bloody wipes on the trail and callie instantly scolded me .	1
i wasnt thinking .	1
callie is like the neatest person ever .	1
theres no chance of getting away with littering when shes around .	1
i retrieved them and stuffed them into my back pocket something fun for mom to find when she does the laundry .	1
youre still bleeding , sydney said .	1
callie , band aid .	1
now , this is where the world gets really scary because callie checked every pocket and she didnt have even one band aid .	1
and then she got real pale .	1
its okay , i said , its not like im going to leave a trail of blood for the two-toed giant bigfoot creature to follow .	1
its almost dried .	1
but callie wasnt thinking about that and she wasnt pale because she got another whiff of sydney either .	1
it was something else .	1
i cant tell which direction to go now .	1
i cant see the sky .	1
chapter 4 - sounds so there we were .	1
lost .	1
deep in the dark forest .	1
monsters lurking .	1
mosquitoes buzzing .	1
spiders watching .	1
blood dripping .	1
dried poop stinking .	1
or something else .	1
.	1
.	1
okay , who let one ?	1
not me .	1
not me .	1
it wasnt me , either , and its different from this stuff thats dried on me , sydney smiled as she said this .	1
nothing gets to that girl .	1
i think shes happy to be lost .	1
maybe its the creature .	1
callie said this like she knew the creature personally and , well , its just the creature .	1
yeah , thats all , the creature just had a little gas , no biggy .	1
i wasnt falling for it .	1
i made a face .	1
i turned .	1
i sniffed .	1
i turned again , sniffed again .	1
i picked a direction .	1
there was nothing stinky to the left so that was going to be our new path .	1
the others followed like the little lambs they are .	1
hey , lets sing .	1
we just ignored sydney on that one .	1
way to not be cool .	1
i dont get why its so dark , callie said as she stumbled along , last in our miniature parade .	1
its only a little bit after one .	1
maybe .	1
i think .	1
yeah , austin agreed .	1
we just had lunch before we came .	1
we havent been out here that long .	1
he really stretched out the word that when he said it .	1
we havent been out here thaaaaaaaaaaaaat long .	1
i wouldnt be making a big deal about how he said it , but it was just that when he was stretching out the word i heard another sound .	1
a sound that could have been someone else trying to mimic him .	1
not an echo exactly .	1
just the aaaaaa sound , like a sheeps bleat or a bubble stuck in your throat or the witch in the wizard of oz before she says my pretty .	1
aaaaaaaaaa .	1
there it was again .	1
what was that ?	1
i asked .	1
i glanced back and again everyone was swinging their heads all around .	1
i knew that they had heard it , too .	1
i could imagine all their arm and leg hairs popping out straight with goose pimply fright .	1
our parade line was tightening up fast as austin crowded up closer to me and sydney reached for austin and callie closed in on syd .	1
the bigfoot , austin breathed .	1
mr. two-toes , sydney said at the same time .	1
callie was a second behind , mr. poopy pants .	1
well , we all had to laugh at that .	1
callie comes out with some good ones all the time .	1
she just slides in a comment that may be only a few words , but she makes us all burst out laughing .	1
thats what we did .	1
we started to laugh and we couldnt seem to stop .	1
my sides started aching and austin was clutching his stomach .	1
this is what i found out later is called hysteria .	1
you start laughing and then you cant stop yourself and you change to crying or you start crying and the opposite happens and you start laughing .	1
its really weird .	1
we were still at the laughing stage , but i could see that there were tears in syd and callies eyes .	1
and sure enough , the next thing i knew they were crying like babies .	1
i might have been , too .	1
austin punched me and then he started yelling at us all to be quiet because he thought he heard something .	1
chapter 5 predator aaaaaaaaaaaaa .	1
rrrrrrrrrrrrr .	1
we huddled .	1
we cuddled .	1
we trembled .	1
the bushes were shaking and something was definitely moving closer .	1
we all started screaming and then the bushes started screaming , too .	1
and then natalie broke through some dense pine boughs , still screaming .	1
okay , back to the hysteria thing .	1
should we laugh or cry ?	1
what a relief it was that the noise we had heard , that aaaaaaaa , was just natalie making her usual grumbling expressions .	1
after youre around her for a while you start to understand her grunts and growls .	1
she can talk , of course , and her last book report in class was like the best one ever , but her family likes to engage in what i would call caveman language .	1
her dad can actually tell a joke without using any english .	1
so , it was natalie .	1
austin was the first to speak real words , natalie , awesome , we thought you couldnt make the fair or we would have waited for you .	1
natalie gave one of her typical half-smiles , a teeny little smirk , a slight upturn of the left side of her mouth , a semi-sneer .	1
gee , maybe i learned a lot from mrs. buckley in fourth grade after all .	1
natalie dropped the mini-smile and said , we got back from evans thing in time .	1
evan is her older brother .	1
hes high school cool .	1
ive been following you guys since you got to the fence .	1
i saw you climb over and i was yelling , but i guess you couldnt hear me .	1
she gave a little hhmmff sound that we all knew meant she really believed that we hadnt heard her and werent trying to ditch her and she was cool with trying to catch up with us .	1
yeah , really , one little sound from her says that much .	1
theres a big animal-monster-bigfoot thing in the woods , sydney informed her , and hes got diarrhea .	1
she waved her fingers in front of her stained shirt and shorts .	1
natalies lip curled up toward her nose .	1
sydney tripped in it .	1
and ive got blood on my legs from when i tripped , i said and looked down to check if the bleeding was still stopped .	1
it was .	1
did you see the footprint ?	1
callie asked .	1
natalie just shook her head no .	1
two-toes this big .	1
syd held her hand out , fingers spread wide .	1
natalies eyes widened .	1
i guess she used all her words up when she first spoke .	1
austin , i just noticed , was still bobbing his head all around , checking the branches above and looking around and behind us .	1
that got me nervous .	1
maybe he was still hearing things .	1
maybe the creature was tracking natalie .	1
you know , a victim alone .	1
one small girl .	1
cute .	1
helpless .	1
making little noises that would attract a predator .	1
predator was a spelling word we had last month .	1
cool that i get to use it in a sentence .	1
i think we should go , austin said .	1
natalie , do you know the way back ?	1
hhkkm .	1
i guess not .	1
we looked at callie .	1
she shrugged her shoulders .	1
her internal compass was still broken .	1
lets vote , sydney grinned .	1
everybody close your eyes and point in the direction you think we should go .	1
then well open our eyes and see which direction most of us are pointing .	1
okay ?	1
we all nodded .	1
close your eyes and point .	1
now one , two , three , open your eyes .	1
in the couple of seconds our eyes were closed i was sure that , even though there are four basic directions , when i opened my eyes id find out that five hands would be pointing in five different directions .	1
i think everybody had the same thought , but youll never guess what i saw when i opened my eyes .	1

smashwords edition contents chapter 1 : super spies chapter 2 : trouble at school and work chapter 3 : department x chapter 4 : second chance chapter 5 : responsibilities to you , the reader : for sharing this world with me .	1
chapter 1 : super spies johnny clunker was a normal and average boy .	1
he was about average height and average build , he had average short brown hair , and a generally nice and normal average smile .	1
except that he wasnt too normal or average as far as those words meant .	1
he went to school , tried to do his homework , and did his best to fit in socially during the day .	1
but at night , shy , weak , and timid johnny clunker became something else entirely .	1
he became a super spy .	1
he became johnny b .	1
fast .	1
he went on important missions to save the world , and they usually went better than the way this one was going right now .	1
what a mess .	1
the entire warehouse was surrounded by united order spies with top of the line gadgets and weapons .	1
it was a rundown , abandoned warehouse , probably used for some type of heavy machinery in the past .	1
there was a partial second floor that looked down on a massive layout of scattered crates and boxes , forming makeshift hallways and rooms .	1
perfect places for hiding .	1
nevertheless , this was going to be harder than usual .	1
johnny looked through his night vision goggles , trying to find all the spies patrol routes .	1
it was his birthday .	1
johnny clunker , or johnny b .	1
fast now that he was undercover , had just turned fifteen years old .	1
this was not a good thing .	1
johnny didnt like birthdays , they were filled with bad memories about bad things that happened to him when he was thirteen .	1
johnny b .	1
fast tried to push the thought out of his head .	1
he forced himself to pay attention to the sentry posts and their routes around the building .	1
maybe he had been wrong , this shouldnt be too hard .	1
but they sure had a lot of spy agents guarding the warehouse tonight .	1
it would probably take only one of the best spies in the world to be able to snatch the united orders super chip right out from under their noses .	1
it would take a super spy to get this super chip .	1
super was an important word in his business .	1
when you got as good as johnny was , they didnt just call you a spy , they called you a super spy .	1
and when you were after a chip as powerful as the one johnny was after tonight , it wouldnt do the chip justice to call it a regular chip .	1
johnny sighed ; he hoped he could live up to the name super .	1
what a mess .	1
the radio in his earpiece went off with a burst .	1
b .	1
fast ?	1
you okay ?	1
johnny whispered back , the microphone in his ear would pick up his words .	1
why wouldnt i be okay ?	1
he hissed , with a bit more nervousness than he wanted to admit .	1
you havent moved from your position in ten years .	1
that was agent ackers , the most sarcastic field operative anyone could ever hope to have helping them .	1
he was assigned to be johnnys ears , eyes , and nose when he was on missions .	1
and if you asked ackers , he would also add brain to that list .	1
agent ackers was in his early twenties , and always stayed back at base where he was safe .	1
he was really skinny , and constantly seemed to have a bunch of pimples sprouting up all over his face .	1
he was very sensitive about his skin condition , and claimed that was why he always stayed back at base .	1
but still , ackers was in his twenties , so at least he had somehow survived fifteen .	1
something johnny hoped to do tonight .	1
are you still there ?	1
ackers hissed in again .	1
im just checking out where all the sentries are .	1
thats my job ; its your job to get the chip .	1
now there should be two more guards in front of you , and three directly below them on the next level .	1
i would recommend being highly stealthy , or taking them all out with a loud bang , ackers advised .	1
those two options are completely opposite from each other !	1
how can you recommend two choices that are so different ?	1
its my job , ackers informed .	1
it was his job to be annoying , thought johnny .	1
now which one is it going to be ?	1
ackers continued .	1
i think ill choose the stealthy option , johnny said .	1
after all , that was the more spy-like thing to do .	1
hey !	1
you there !	1
what are you doing ?	1
from out of the corner of his eye , johnny could see that he had allowed a guard to sneak up on him while he was talking with ackers .	1
that type of thing usually didnt happen to him .	1
its just great having a birthday , he thought .	1
the guard was wearing all black , covered from head to toe in a shadow guard uniform .	1
there was a circular insignia on the left side of his uniform that meant the united order , which also meant bad and evil .	1
the shadow guard uniform had a unique ability to bend light and make the wearer appear to be invisible , but it drained a lot of resources and was generally not used , making the shadow guards stand out more than they intended to blend in .	1
johnny always wanted to point out the irony of the uniform to the guards , but he didnt think now was the best time .	1
guarding the chip , johnny said instead , trying to answer the guards question .	1
johnny wasnt wearing their uniform , so his response was a little suspicious .	1
ive never seen you before , the guard responded , raising his gun and pointing it at johnny .	1
johnny slowly got to his feet .	1
im with the second division .	1
youve probably never heard of us because its our job to not only guard the chip , but also to make sure the first division , which is you guys , are doing their job properly .	1
we do our job best by making sure that you guys dont know were doing our job when youre doing yours .	1
the guard got lost in johnnys rambling .	1
what second division ?	1
ah , you see ?	1
johnny said triumphantly .	1
youve never even heard of us .	1
we wouldnt be very good at our job if everyone in the first division knew the second division was watching their every move .	1
there is no second or first division !	1
the guard said angrily .	1
johnny looked distraught .	1
you mean you dont even know youre in the first division ?	1
what division did you think you were in ?	1
johnny asked .	1
the guard wrung his hands in frustration .	1
there are no divisions !	1
he hollered back .	1
johnny winced at how loud the guard was being .	1
he was pretty sure that he could take down one guard pretty easily .	1
he could probably even take out two , three with the help of some of his gadgets .	1
okay , maybe even four or five with the help of some of his really advanced spy gadgets .	1
johnny had a really high opinion of himself , but he wasnt sure if he could take down every guard in the warehouse singlehandedly .	1
at least not today ; it was his birthday , after all .	1
there are always divisions , johnny instructed .	1
the guard looked confused .	1
for instance , johnny continued his lecture while the guard kept the gun pointed at him , right now you are on one side and i am on the other .	1
its a good thing you have a gun , because that at least helps johnny stopped talking .	1
lightning quick , he stepped in close and to the side of the gun , karate chopping a specific nerve on the guards neck .	1
johnny caught the gun as the guard dropped it .	1
to try and even the odds , johnny continued .	1
the guard fell to the ground , stunned , but still conscious .	1
see ?	1
without the gun you would have had almost no chance .	1
you talk too much , ackers chimed in through the ear piece .	1
i wasnt talking to you .	1
i cant help but hear every word you say .	1
its one of the hardest things about my job , and the source of my extremely large therapy bills , ackers informed him with an exaggerated sniffle .	1
you dont have to pay for your therapy bills , johnny said .	1
still have to make the time , ackers quipped back .	1
dont blame your skin condition johnny tried to add , but ackers beat him to it .	1
cant talk about that .	1
off the record .	1
how come you get to pick whats always on or off the record ?	1
johnny asked .	1
thats also my job .	1
right , thought johnny .	1
he kneeled down beside the still conscious guard .	1
anyway , the moral of the story is : you were right the first time , there is no second division , johnny informed the guard as he knocked him unconscious .	1
did you knock him out with that neck nerve pinch thing ?	1
asked ackers .	1
yup , johnny lied .	1
one day youre going to have to show me how you do that .	1
nope , super spy secret , replied johnny .	1
im going radio silent now .	1
* * * johnny ran down the stairs leading to the first floor and the area where the chip was to be exchanged .	1
the united order was paying a lot of money to get a computer processor chip from a group of scientists who claimed that they found a way to make cpu chips faster without burning out from the heat build up .	1
if the united order was able to duplicate this chip before anyone else , they would have the fastest computers on the planet .	1
not that they even needed to do that , it sounded like just having one of these chips would be enough to dominate the entire worlds technological resources .	1
there were a lot of guards on the floor , seven to be exact .	1
that was supposed to be a lucky number , thought johnny .	1
the guards patrolled the floor with a bored and sloppy demeanor , none of them were expecting anything to happen .	1
that would be johnnys biggest weapon , the element of surprise .	1
he slowly snuck around a few crates until he could get a good view of the center of the warehouse .	1
there were three scientists speaking to someone in the united order , not a guard , someone who actually looked important .	1
the man turned and johnny got a good look at his face .	1
he had a big scar that ran down from one side of his face to the other .	1
he was also very , very tall , towering over everyone near him .	1
the three scientists all seemed very nervous around him .	1
and the man , johnny decided to call him scar , loomed over everyone , intimidating them with his ugly glower .	1
let me see it , scar demanded .	1
the scientists all motioned to each other nervously .	1
finally , one of them , the one at the very back of the group , shook his head .	1
scar raised his eyebrows in warning .	1
we would like to see the money first , the brave scientist spoke with a scared and squeaky voice .	1
please , he added , taking away much of his show of strength .	1
of course , scar replied .	1
scar raised his hand , palm out , towards the brave scientist .	1
his colleagues around him instantly parted , leaving the brave scientist standing all by himself .	1
a blinding white light shot out of scars hand and completely enveloped the brave scientist .	1
johnny was forced to look away from the brightness , but he heard the scream that followed .	1
when the light finally died down , johnny looked back and saw a steaming skeleton lying on the ground where the brave scientist used to be .	1
johnnys mouth hung open in shock .	1
the rest of the scientists looked from their dead partner and slowly back to scar .	1
i hope , for all your sakes , that he was not the one carrying the chip , scar boomed .	1
no , no , i have it right here .	1
one of the scientists held up the super chip .	1
without a word , scar snatched it from his hand and examined it .	1
scar brought out what looked like a small , green lens .	1
he looked through it at the chip and was able to see the chip magnified hundreds of times .	1
as you can see , the scientist continued , the chip uses light as registers , being able to withstand heat and process computer instructions at speeds of up to ten times or more than the best modern computers .	1
with this chip you would have a huge advantage over the rest of the world .	1
scar checked the connections and the registers as the scientist blabbed on until he was satisfied that he was holding the right processing chip .	1
this is the one , he said at last , lowering the magnifying lens .	1
and now our payment ?	1
another scientist asked .	1
scar motioned to the seven guards around him , who instantly surrounded the scientist and brought up their guns .	1
butwe brought you what you asked for , and we didnt try to double cross you , stammered a scientist in protest .	1
you did , admitted scar .	1
how very foolish of you .	1
with an icy cold stare at the scientists , scar nodded his head .	1
the seven guards instantly fired white beams from their guns , similar to the beam that came out of the device on scars palm , but without nearly the amount of brightness or power .	1
the scientists shrieked as they were melted down to their skeletal form , and then they all fell over each other to form a pile of bones .	1
it was too late to save the scientists , but johnny b .	1
fast had to act fast before scar got away with the super chip .	1
peeking out from his hiding spot , johnny planned his attack .	1
all the guards were standing very close to each other , which was the perfect time to strike .	1
still , he waited until scar started to walk away .	1
there was something about him that johnny didnt like .	1
it wasnt that he was scared of him , johnny b .	1
fast wasnt scared of anyone , but still , it didnt hurt to be safe rather than sorry .	1
once scar was far enough away , johnny bolted .	1
he came running out of his hiding spot , throwing out what looked like a yo-yo as he ran .	1
the guards all yelled in surprise , but before they could mobilize , the yo-yo shot out and wrapped around three of the seven guards .	1
as the string started to go around them , it grew in length and stuck to their clothes , creating a sticky web that kept their arms pinned to their sides .	1
the other four guards would be more of a problem .	1
they were far enough away that johnny couldnt use a similar gadget to stop them .	1
they brought up their laser guns and aimed them at johnny .	1
johnny slid to the ground and threw an egg at the floor .	1
as soon as the egg hit the ground it exploded into a strobe of multiple colors , flashing and blinding everyone in the immediate area except for johnny , who had kept his eyes closed when the egg burst .	1
lasers shot randomly over his head .	1
johnny stayed low to the ground as he quickly ran toward the nearest guard .	1
when the lights stopped , johnny figured he would be taking down the four guards before they would have a chance to recuperate and figure out what happened .	1
he just had to position himself to be at the right spot at the right moment .	1
thats what being a spy was all about .	1
the strobe light stopped , and johnny was ready to take down the five guards ?	1
six ?	1
where did that other one come from ?	1
seven , no eight guards .	1
plus the two in the back .	1
johnny wasnt sure what happened .	1
there were only supposed to be four guards , and now he had to deal with ten ?	1
things were not turning out as they were supposed to .	1
if johnny could get out of this in one piece , he would have to strongly consider taking a year off the spy business .	1
the ten guards , who could now see , brought their laser guns up in johnnys direction .	1
he had to think of something , fast .	1
really fast .	1
johnny froze .	1
uh oh , he managed to say .	1
it looked like turning fifteen wasnt going to work out very well for johnny b .	1
fast .	1
but then she appeared out of nowhere .	1
dropping down on the first guard from the half floor above , she knocked him out and instantly sprang toward the second .	1
before johnny or any of the other guards knew what was happening , the young girl had already knocked down four of the ten guards .	1
they looked to be unconscious , and johnny wasnt exactly sure what she was able to do to knock them out so fast .	1
the girl was wearing a black outfit and her brown hair was tide back in a ponytail .	1
she moved so gracefully and quickly that none of the guards had a chance to react .	1
reaching into a pouch at her side , the girl threw out a rubber ball at the group of six guards that were left .	1
the ball hit one of them right in the chest and then exploded out into a net that covered them all .	1
one of the guards managed to get out as the net fully caught and then electrocuted the remaining five .	1
johnny and the guard looked at her in awe .	1
are they dead ?	1
johnny asked .	1
just unconscious , she replied .	1
johnny and the last guard looked back at the net .	1
it was at that moment that they both realized they werent on the same team .	1
the guard brought up his laser gun , but johnny quickly knocked it aside and punched him out .	1
nice move , the girl commented as she looked at the nine guards she had taken out all by herself .	1
thanks .	1
um , you too , nice move , i mean moves , because you did more than my one .	1
the girl laughed at him ; it was a nice melodic sound , but johnny didnt like the fact that it was directed at him .	1
the warehouse was now empty , both scar and the chip were long gone .	1
the girl got a closer look at him .	1
youre that boy from school , johnny somethingclunker !	1
johnny clunker .	1
johnny hated his real name .	1
what kind of a name was clunker ?	1
it was the sort of name that guaranteed you wouldnt get picked for teams , or get to hang out with the cool kids .	1
it practically begged teachers who saw it on test papers to try and find any way they could to give him a failing mark .	1
no matter which way you looked at it , clunker was not cool .	1
which is what he capitalized on in school to keep his super spy identity secret , but that didnt mean he had to like it .	1
thats not my real name !	1
he blurted out before he could really think about it .	1
why did she make him so nervous ?	1
no , it is my real name .	1
but its not the name im going under right now , he tried to correct himself .	1
whats the name youre going under right now ?	1
she asked the obvious question , her eyebrow arched up in an amused glance .	1
im johnny b .	1
fast , he said , holding out his hand .	1
and im a super spy .	1
the girl looked at him for a moment and then burst out laughing again .	1
johnny felt really foolish holding out his hand for her to shake while she was laughing at him .	1
he slowly retracted his hand .	1
thanks , he mumbled .	1
she quickly composed herself .	1
im sorry .	1
i never met a spy who introduced themselves as a spy before .	1
maybe i admitted i was a spy to throw you off and make you think the last thing i was was a spy ?	1
johnny tried .	1
she looked like she was going to laugh again .	1
he had to get a hold of himself ; why was he so nervous ?	1
forget it , that just sounded terrible , he admitted .	1
she could see he was suffering , and her heart went out to him , i didnt mean to laugh , she offered .	1
yes you did , he shot back .	1
i guess no one ever means to laugh when they laugh .	1
thats the whole point of laughing , it takes you by surprise , she reasoned .	1
what a strange girl she was .	1
still , johnny couldnt deny the fact that she had flawlessly taken out ten guards by herself .	1
nine !	1
johnny had taken care of the last one , even if he was preoccupied at the time , it still counted .	1
trying to make up , she held out her hand for him to shake .	1
my real names nancy korrins , but you can call me seventy-seven .	1
seventy-seven ?	1
johnny asked .	1
yup , she offered back , her hand still stuck out between them .	1
what kind of a name is that ?	1
its my spy name , she replied , taking back her hand .	1
thats not a very cool spy name , johnny said .	1
spy names arent supposed to be cool , they just are .	1
johnny shook his head .	1
whats the point of having a spy name if it isnt going to be cool ?	1
thats just guy talk .	1
guys are always trying to look cool , or be cool , or have cool names , she reasoned .	1
besides , the whole point of it all is to save the world from evil .	1
i think the world would rather be saved by johnny b .	1
fast than by seventy-seven , johnny shot back .	1
i dont think the world cares who saves it , as long as its saved , nancy , or seventy-seven , replied .	1
as they were talking , a lone guard , the last one left in the warehouse , crept slowly toward them .	1
he had a laser gun in his hands , and he made sure to keep it lowered as he approached .	1
both johnny and nancy were too involved in their argument to notice .	1
spy names arent even supposed to be known , theyre supposed to be a secret !	1
nancy argued .	1
the guard got closer .	1
he could have taken the shot then , but he wanted to get even closer so that he couldnt miss .	1
maybe he could even take both of them out in one shot ?	1
you know , i didnt ask for your help , johnny stated .	1
but you needed it .	1
no , i had everything under control , johnny replied .	1
im sure thats what you thought , before you jumped in the middle of that group of , was it ten people ?	1
she asked , feigning not knowing how many guards there had been .	1
i was right about to take care of them .	1
im sure you were .	1
i had several ways of doing it !	1
he practically screamed at her .	1
id like to see one of them , she stated coolly .	1
and until i do , im going to assume that i saved you and that you need to thank me .	1
the guard was in position , he wasnt going to get a better shot than this .	1
he raised his laser gun up high , set it for an explosive blast , and aimed it at the two of them .	1
well , for one thing , i could have done this .	1
in one quick movement , johnny leaned sideways and threw a handful of marbles past nancy .	1
at the same time , nancy turned around and brought a whistle to her lips , letting out a sharp trill that caused the guard to drop his laser gun and grab his ears in pain as he was lifted off his feet from the blast .	1
meanwhile , the marbles johnny threw reached the guard and exploded , drenching him in a kaleidoscope of multicolored extra sticky paint .	1
the guard passed out .	1
johnny and nancy turned to look at each other .	1
i got him first , johnny stated .	1
you did not , nancy replied .	1
* * * the moon cast a soft glow on the perfect looking neighborhood street .	1
the houses were all lined up in an orderly fashion down a straight road , and even the sidewalk was immaculate , with no cracks or chips that could be seen .	1
large , overgrown trees dotted the landscape , creating dark leering shadows over the houses .	1
johnny and nancy walked along the sidewalk .	1
every third house they passed was the exact same model , leaving only three distinct types of homes in the neighborhood .	1
most of the houses on the street had their lights off , hinting at the lateness of the hour .	1
that one is mine , johnny pointed to a house that looked mostly like all the others .	1
looks like dads asleep .	1
your father lets you stay up this late on a school night ?	1
nancy asked .	1
im a spy , staying out late is part of the job description , seventy-seven .	1
he used her spy name in a mocking tone , trying to get back at her for making fun of his own .	1
besides , he usually goes to sleep early .	1
lots of stress at work gets him tired .	1
as soon as he had said it , a light went on in the house .	1
guess hes up ; going to have to sneak in again , said johnny .	1
what about your mom ?	1
she asked .	1
johnny looked down at the ground as they walked , suddenly getting quiet .	1
nancy realized that something was wrong , and thought it would be wise to give him his space .	1
they stopped walking and stood in front of his house .	1
johnny looked over at it .	1
the house was small , as houses go , but it looked comfortable and cozy .	1
my mom passed away a couple of years ago , johnny finally said .	1
when i was thirteen .	1
im sorry , nancy reached out her hand and placed it on his shoulder .	1
its been me and my dad since then .	1
he does what he can , but sometimes he doesnt really know how to be a mom .	1
especially at dinner time , johnny said as he watched his house .	1
nancy finally took her hand back .	1
does he know what you do ?	1
johnny almost laughed out loud .	1
no way .	1
if he found out id never be able to keep doing it .	1
being a spy isnt exactly a normal thing for someone still going to school .	1
johnny turned to look at her .	1
do your parents know ?	1
no .	1
well , i dont really know who my real parents are , nancy admitted .	1
how can you not know who your real parents are ?	1
i was adopted , she informed him .	1
theres no way they would be able to sleep at night if they knew i was out fighting crime .	1
johnny nodded in silence .	1
i guess were a lot like each other , johnny thought out loud .	1
in your dreams , she informed him .	1
i was trying to make you feel better .	1
like you could almost be in the same league as me , johnny shot back .	1
we didnt do that great tonight , the super chip got away , nancy said .	1
dont worry , well get it back .	1
besides , its just a little super chip , no big deal .	1
it is a big deal if you consider that with something that powerful , a normal computer could hack into and overrun any security network on the planet , giving the user access to funds , secrets , weapons , even nuclear weapons , nancy said , a worried expression coming over her face .	1
like i said , its no big deal , johnny tried to lighten the mood .	1
she smiled uneasily back .	1
it was such a small thing , the super chip .	1
it couldnt outright attack anyone , or be used to physically harm anything .	1
it was hard to believe that it presented much of a danger at all .	1
but that only increased its deceptive threat .	1
the super chip would act like a cancer , starting small and unnoticed , and slowly growing and tightening its hold until there was no way to separate it and no way to stop it .	1
from a small nothing to a world shaking monster , the united order would use the chip to make all technological security obsolete .	1
they would be in every corporation , every network , and inside every home .	1
they wouldnt be hacking into the system , they would be the system , and everyone else would be at their mercy .	1
nancy stepped away , getting ready to leave .	1
hey , where are you going ?	1
johnny asked .	1
home .	1
where do you live ?	1
he asked .	1
just a few streets down , she motioned with her hand .	1
johnny looked down the street , at the shadows and the swaying tree branches .	1
its late , i should walk you .	1
i walked you home today , you can walk me home next time , she informed him .	1
but its late , and youre a girl , its not safe , he pressed the issue .	1
you mean its not safe around me .	1
are you already forgetting how i saved you back at the warehouse ?	1
she asked .	1
i would have taken care of all of them , johnny started .	1
you would have , im sure of that beyond any doubt , but you didnt have to because i was there , nancy stated boldly .	1
she reached behind and pulled out an odd looking device .	1
it had a small handle , with three tubes extending out of it , and a large trigger just off the handle .	1
that looks like a cool gadget , johnny stated , his eyes instantly drawn to the technological wonder in her hands .	1
being a spy isnt about cool gadgets and names , she said again .	1
its half of it , or most of it anyway , johnny insisted , never taking his eyes off the device .	1
how does it work , what does it do ?	1
let me show you , she leaned in close , very close , johnny noticed as he felt a flutter in his stomach , and showed him the device .	1
she then pointed it at the trees and said , go go gadget she stopped short , noticing the look on his face and burst out laughing .	1
actually , you just push this button , she managed to say , after she got control over her laughter .	1
thats what i thought , johnny returned , doing his best to look and act as cool as possible after she was done laughing at him , again .	1
she pointed the small , hand held device at the branch of a nearby tree .	1
she pushed the button and a small grapnel shot out of the three tubes and attached itself to the tree trunk .	1
see you at school , johnny breakfast .	1
with a whoosh , nancy zipped up off the ground and disappeared into the depths of the trees .	1
its b .	1
fast !	1
johnny called after her .	1
* * * johnny quietly opened the door to his room and slipped inside .	1
his room looked like an average enough room , in keeping with his secret identity ; there was a desk , computer , chair , and all his clothes dumped wherever there was a spot on the floor .	1
his walls were all white , and there wasnt a single thing on any of them , and his bed was up against the wall directly opposite from the door , nothing you would expect from a super spy .	1
johnny quickly changed out of his spy clothes and into a t-shirt and a pair of jeans .	1
he picked up his cast-off clothes from the floor and rummaged through them .	1
johnny pulled out an assortment of spy gadgets and weapons .	1
he put them down in a drawer in his computer desk , removed the ear piece out of his ear and tossed it in with everything else , then slid the drawer closed .	1
johnny looked at the computer and sighed .	1
it looked like it was older than he was , with a monitor so small that laptops had bigger screens .	1
the computer was turned off .	1
he leaned over and started typing on the keyboard : johnny is the best spy in the world !	1
as soon as he hit the exclamation mark , a small humming noise came from all over the room .	1
panels in the wall slid up to reveal multiple display screens , the ceiling opened up slightly and a projector slipped out , turning on and displaying a holographic display of even more screens and a keyboard , all hovering in the air before him .	1
johnny walked over to the floating keyboard and started typing in midair with furious speed .	1
one of the monitors against the wall lit up with an image of an irate agent ackers .	1
pimples covered his entire face .	1
im going radio silent now , ackers started mimicking johnny with heavy sarcasm .	1
gee , that was only , i dont know , a million years ago !	1
we werent alive a million years ago , johnny said .	1
ackers froze him with a look .	1
johnny glanced apologetically at ackers face .	1
there was a two way video connection with them , so they could both hear and see each other .	1
im sorry ackers , something came up , johnny explained .	1
something is supposed to come up !	1
ackers explained .	1
youre on a mission , things are supposed to come up and im supposed to help you deal with them .	1
i know , it was an oversight .	1
oversight ?	1
whats that ?	1
i think it was more like an over-mind , as in it was over and out of your mind to think about keeping me in the loop .	1
how am i supposed to help you if you dont let me help you ?	1
johnny shrugged .	1
if it wasnt for this , ackers gestured to the pimples all over his face , id be out there with you in the field .	1
instead , im locked up here in a basement , nurturing my skin condition and wondering what happened to the agent im supposed to be backing because he put me on radio silence !	1
johnny had to lean back and listen to ackers yell .	1
ackers didnt mean to get so upset ; he was really a good guy .	1
johnny could understand the frustration he must have felt at not knowing what was going on .	1
still , johnny didnt understand why pimples on a face would keep someone from being out there in the field .	1
johnny suspected it had more to do with ackers courage than his pimples .	1
ive been thinking , ackers continued .	1
they shouldnt even allow you to be able to put me on radio silence .	1
it shouldnt even be an option that you have .	1
im supposed to advise and guide you during missions , and if i think you not being advised or guided by me is a bad thing , then you shouldnt be able to do it .	1
his rant should be coming to an end soon , thought johnny .	1
they usually lasted a certain amount of time , and johnny could tell that ackers was beginning to slow down and run out of things to say .	1
i think i will put in a request for having that option removed before your next mission , but ackers kept going .	1
maybe he had a bit more left to complain about .	1
johnny liked ackers .	1
how could he not ?	1
he knew ackers meant well .	1
there was a knock at the door .	1
it was his dad !	1
johnny sprang into action .	1
he couldnt let his dad see all the computers and gadgets .	1
sorry ackers , have to go .	1
johnny had two choices , he could type in his password into the old keyboard lying on the desk , or he could hit enter and put the whole system into sleep mode .	1
son , can i come in ?	1
his father asked from behind the door .	1
there wasnt any time to type in the whole password .	1
just a moment dad !	1
i suppose youre going to go radio silent again ?	1
ackers asked sarcastically .	1
johnny didnt even bother to reply , he slammed the enter key on his old computer as hard as he could .	1
all the panels slid down covering the monitors , the projector from the ceiling turned off , killing the holographic displays .	1
the projector then slid up , allowing the hole in the ceiling to close .	1
within moments johnnys room looked just like an ordinary room again .	1
johnny jumped onto his bed and grabbed a comic .	1
okay dad , come on in , johnny called .	1
the door opened and his dad , henry clunker , walked into the room .	1
johnnys dad was about medium height and slightly pudgy .	1
his hair always looked a bit uncombed , and his glasses were always a little crooked .	1
he was easy with a smile and quite clumsy , getting into accidents more often than he cared to admit .	1
what was taking you so long ?	1
henry asked .	1
i had to clean up my room a bit , johnny answered .	1
henry looked around the messy room ; there were clothes still on the floor and things still out of place .	1
henry would have hated to see what it looked like before johnny cleaned .	1
dont worry , ill get to it , johnny said , seeing his dads bemused look .	1
oh , of course , henry said .	1
henry wasnt big into discipline , so he usually made a small attempt , and then ended up giving in with an , oh , of course , to whatever reason johnny had for not doing what he was supposed to be doing .	1
its kind of late , isnt it ?	1
henry asked .	1
yeah , i was just going to do some homework before going to bed , johnny offered , before realizing he was holding a comic .	1
he quickly shoved it aside .	1
henry nodded and beamed .	1
that was his son , always staying on top of his school work .	1
thats great to hear son , im so happy you take your school work so seriously .	1
johnny smiled weakly .	1
he was going to have to put more time into some of his subjects .	1
truth be told , being a super spy was a difficult business , and he didnt always find time to fit school into his schedule as much as he liked , especially when it came to ms. sniders and her english class .	1
i just got this note from school , henry continued , reaching into his pocket and pulling out a paper on school letterhead .	1
its from ms. sniders .	1
i believe shes your english teacher ?	1
johnny swallowed uneasily .	1
how bad could it get ?	1
he thought of the woman , and she somehow reached out from across space and time to torment him .	1
uh , yeah , shes my english teacher , was all johnny could say .	1
are you having some trouble in her class ?	1
henry asked , a concerned look on his face .	1
johnnys dad would believe anything he said , and it was because of that very reason that johnny hated lying to him .	1
i just dont get some of the things she teaches very well , johnny said .	1
he didnt tell his dad the part about her being a lousy teacher who couldnt teach a newborn baby how to breathe if she had to .	1
or the fact that she could suck all the happiness and motivation out of a classroom just by giving students her evil glare .	1
henry leaned back against johnnys computer desk and accidentally hit the enter key on the keyboard as he was settling down to read the note .	1
instantly , all the panels slid up , the projector came down from the ceiling and projected the three dimensional keyboard right behind where johnnys dad was leaning .	1
ackers angry and impatient face came up on the screen at the far end of the wall on a screen almost as big as the wall itself , magnifying every aspect of his pimples and his disgruntled scowl .	1
henry missed all of this as he was studying the note .	1
yes , it says here that you havent been handing in all your assignments , and that you dont do very well on some of the essays , henry continued .	1
johnny had to do something !	1
he couldnt let his dad see all the super spy equipment that johnny had installed in their house .	1
ill try harder dad , johnny started to say as he tried to move , without drawing too much attention , to get near the keyboard with the enter key that would hide all the advanced technology .	1
she just doesnt explain some of the concepts of english very well , like all those words and sentences and things , johnny wasnt even thinking about what he was saying , he was just trying to find a way to get to that keyboard .	1
henry put the note down and looked at his son .	1
johnny froze .	1
i just wish you would have come to me sooner about all of this .	1
im pretty good at english .	1
i used to do well back in the day before we had all these computers to do our spellchecking and thinking for us , henry patted the monitor of the ten year old computer he was leaning beside .	1
johnny looked from the old , antique computer beside his dad to the three dimensional keyboard and super flat monitors behind him , not to mention the larger than life display of ackers on the far wall who was still glowering and scowling and looking generally put out and neglected .	1
henry put his hand on his sons shoulder .	1
son , well do what we can to bring your mark up .	1
dont worry about this , your dad is on the scene now , and together we can do anything !	1
henry was always super optimistic about everything .	1
not that that was a bad thing , but sometimes johnny felt that his dad , as much as johnny loved him , was a bit nave about how the world worked .	1
johnny felt guilty as soon as he had the thought .	1
his dad was just trying to help .	1
well start studying together tomorrow , henry said as he turned to walk away .	1
dad !	1
johnny cried out .	1
henry turned back in alarm , having just missed seeing the advanced computers behind him .	1
the giant display of ackers shook his head in the background , and slapped a supersized hand against his supersized head .	1
it made a small noise and henry almost turned around again .	1
johnny grabbed his dads shoulders and spun him around to face him again .	1
what !	1
what is it son ?	1
henry asked in alarm .	1
i just wanted to let you know that i appreciate what youre doing for me .	1
and that i wont let you down .	1
math might be a hard subject for me , but i think that with your help ill be able to get through it .	1
as johnny spoke , he slowly made his way around to get closer to the keyboard of his ten year old computer .	1
are you having trouble in math as well ?	1
henry asked .	1
i meant english , johnny corrected himself .	1
ackers just shook his head in the background , exasperated .	1
it makes me really proud to hear you say that , henry said , beaming .	1
i know that if your mother could see you and your dedication , she would be proud too .	1
johnny finally made it to the keyboard and quickly hit the enter key .	1
all the computer screens were instantly covered with a panel sliding down .	1
ackers opened his mouth to say something , but he was shut out before he could make a noise .	1
the projector in the ceiling retracted up and out of sight , the three dimensional display of the keyboard disappearing along with it .	1
johnny let out a sigh of relief .	1
his father turned around then , to see what had troubled johnny so much .	1
seeing an ordinary looking messy room , henry turned back to face his son .	1
dont worry yourself so much , you dont have to clean your room tonight .	1
i can see that this is a big commitment from you , henry said , holding up the letter , not knowing the truth of johnnys distress .	1
well start first thing tomorrow morning .	1
dont you worry , well get a tutor , several if we have to !	1
this seems to mean a lot to you , and i wont let you down !	1
henrys father clamped a hand down on his sons shoulder , giving it a reassuring squeeze .	1
now its late , get some sleep , henry turned and made his way out of the room , but not before he ran into the desk and door on his way out .	1
excuse me , henry said as he exited .	1
johnnys dad was very clumsy ; it somehow fit with their last name : clunker .	1
johnny fell back on his bed and closed his eyes in despair .	1
he hated english class .	1
* * * in a darkened room with a single light source sat a woman with jet black hair .	1
the widow black was her spy name , and she was watching a computer monitor which showed the fight at the warehouse over the super chip .	1
she was dressed all in black , with a single zipper that ran up the front of her skin-tight suit .	1
the widow black moved her hand in the air , and the monitors changed to show a different perspective of the fight .	1
she was wearing a glove on her right hand with blinking lights all over it .	1
with gestures from her hand , she was able to control the computers in the room .	1
she was in her late forties , but it was almost impossible to tell her exact age because of her extreme beauty and wild , flowing hair .	1
her face resembled a classical statue ; it was both beautiful and cold .	1
her lips made a determined , thin line as she watched footage of johnny and nancy fighting the guards .	1
poorly executed .	1
sloppy , she commented .	1
it was hard to tell whether she was talking about the guards , or the way that johnny and nancy were able to beat them .	1
the widow black watched as johnny and nancy talked .	1
never speak to the enemy , and never during a hot zone , she said to herself .	1
she waved her hand in the air , and the image froze on johnny .	1
the widow black stared at the image , studying it .	1
you are in over your head , and there will come a time when you will regret these actions .	1
she lingered on the image a bit , before finally tilting her finger and allowing it to continue playing .	1
the widow black brought her other hand up to her ear and pressed a button on a device .	1
a voice came through on the other end ; it was scars .	1
yes ?	1
you have the chip , the widow black told as much as asked .	1
we have it .	1
good .	1
i will meet with you .	1
i will give you the coordinates .	1
there was a measure of malice in the widow blacks voice .	1
dont let anything happen to that chip .	1
chapter 2 : trouble at school and work the school looked just like a regular school , so naturally johnny didnt feel like going inside .	1
it wasnt that he disliked school , he just felt that he didnt apply himself enough , which usually brought up feelings of guilt .	1
he wanted to apply himself more , but with his regular spy job it was becoming harder and harder to sleep , let alone study .	1
still , as johnny went through his usual excuses in his head , he knew that he had no one to blame but himself .	1
school was important , and it was doubly important to a super spy who had to know everything he could about the world .	1
ill do better , he promised himself .	1
a passing kid heard him say it and turned to look .	1
seeing that there was no one else around , the kid realized that johnny was talking to himself .	1
slightly embarrassed , johnny gave him a weak smile .	1
the kid looked away and shook his head .	1
i have to make sure no one thinks im crazy while i do better , johnny thought , wanting to avoid any further stares and head shakings .	1
at least it helped with his identity , making it even more likely that he was unlikely to be a super spy .	1
he also wanted a chance to try and talk to nancy .	1
johnny was interested in how she became a super spy , and found out about the chip and where it was being traded , and how she learned how to fight like that , and where she got all those cool gadgets .	1
his mind thoroughly off of his school subjects , johnny headed into the school without much prospect of doing better at it .	1
* * * nancy !	1
johnny whispered as loud as he could while still being able to call what he was doing whispering .	1
she sat just ahead of him , and currently had her back to him while she was listening to their english teacher talk about english .	1
nancy , johnny tried again .	1
ms. sniders , their english teacher , swooped her beady eyes around the room from the front of the class .	1
did i hear someone talking ?	1
she asked .	1
johnny lowered in his seat and kept his eyes down .	1
ms. sniders was an old , strict woman .	1
she liked her class to be absolutely silent while she taught .	1
she had been known to throw students in detention , make them write extra essays , and even create entire extra projects just because they were found talking in class .	1
johnny did not want to have to write any essays or create any projects .	1
he waited while she passed by his desk , looking for another sound from the culprit .	1
she was a tall , thin woman .	1
every single student in her ninth grade class had to look up to her , and every single student was also scared to death of her .	1
she had really thick glasses that looked like they went out of style sixty years ago , and the dresses she wore always had polka dots on them .	1
i know i heard talking .	1
you might as well come clean now before it gets worse for you , she said as she stalked down the aisles of desks .	1
if theres one thing we all hate , its talking .	1
ms. sniders always included the entire class in on what it was she hated .	1
she passed by johnnys desk again , adjusting her glasses as she stared in his direction .	1
johnny kept his eyes down to the ground .	1
she must have developed very strong neck muscles by having to keep her head up with those really heavy glasses on .	1
johnny bet that if she took off the glasses , her head would whip back with the tremendous force of years of straining muscles .	1
if the culprit refuses to come clean , if they insist on hiding , in spite of how much we all hate cowards , then i have no choice but to continue the lesson .	1
that didnt sound like much of a threat to johnny , in spite of the fact that he hated her lessons .	1
she turned her back to them and began to write on the board .	1
it didnt seem like ms. sniders liked being a teacher .	1
nancy !	1
johnny tried again .	1
nancy turned her head back to look at him slightly .	1
are you insane ?	1
she asked .	1
i wanted to ask you some more questions about last night .	1
now ?	1
nancy hissed back .	1
even though they were both super spies , neither one of them wanted to mess with ms. sniders .	1
i wanted to ask how you became a spy , johnny pressed .	1
no , well talk later , nancy turned around and faced the front again .	1
but johnny wasnt finished .	1
dont worry , shes old and probably as deaf as as deaf as what ?	1
boomed ms. sniders voice .	1
johnny froze .	1
she was standing directly beside him , hands on hips , stern glare directed straight down on him .	1
johnny thought she had still been at the front of the class ; he hadnt even noticed her make her way over to his desk .	1
he tried to answer her , his mouth moved , but for some reason no sounds were coming out .	1
out with it mr. clunker , we all want to hear what you have to say .	1
johnny looked around the room .	1
all of his classmates , including nancy , were looking at him .	1
it certainly seemed like they all wanted to hear what he had to say .	1
johnny wanted to hear it also , because he had no idea what it was that he should say .	1
i was just thinking , johnny started .	1
what else should he say ?	1
that he was wondering how someone else managed to become a super spy ?	1
i was just wondering , johnny stammered .	1
yes mr. clunker , you were thinking and wondering what ?	1
the condition of my deafness ?	1
ms. sniders leaned down and sneered in his face , waiting for his answer .	1
her breath smelled foul and old , like the air from a long sealed tomb .	1
johnny actually had an experience with a tomb and mummy , so he knew exactly what that smelled like .	1
he could do this .	1
just think of something to say that would get her far away from him .	1
the problem was that her breath was so bad that it was driving out any other thought that johnny might have had .	1
his eyes strayed to the board .	1
ms. sniders was writing the chapter homework for the week .	1
it was all johnny had , so he grabbed it .	1
i was just wondering , just thinking if we could move on ahead , beyond the assigned chapter , and do extra work for the week .	1
it wasnt great .	1
it wasnt even good ; in fact , it was pretty bad , but at least johnny had thought of something .	1
ms. sniders looked at him a moment longer .	1
johnny had to put up with that foul breath for just a few more seconds and then he would be fine .	1
he wondered what it was in her mouth that could take normal smelling air and turn it into such a brutal weapon in the time it took someone to inhale and exhale .	1
finally , after what seemed like an eternity , ms. sniders straightened up .	1
johnny breathed in fresh air .	1
he hadnt noticed , but he had started holding his breath .	1
you were thinking , using all your little brain power to ask me if you could do extra work ?	1
ms. sniders asked as she stalked down the aisle and back to the front of the class .	1
johnny couldnt understand it , but a lot of the other students were looking at him with a grim attitude .	1
why ?	1
what had he done ?	1
as you know class , i dont believe there is such a thing as a stupid question .	1
you have to learn , the government pays me a meager salary to make sure that you do , so questions are part of your expected job requirement , she continued .	1
johnny had a nagging feeling in his stomach , like he had just done something that he was going to regret .	1
and then , it slowly came to him .	1
he realized what he had done .	1
asking me if you can do more work is , in fact , a stupid question , ms. sniders proclaimed as she looked straight at johnny .	1
not only is more work encouraged in most classes , it is expected in mine .	1
so thanks to mr. clunker , we are all going to do three chapters , instead of one , for the week .	1
we are all very grateful for mr. clunkers insight .	1
johnny started sinking down in his chair .	1
there she went using that we word again .	1
johnny was pretty sure she wouldnt be doing any chapters at all .	1
the grim faces around him turned to angry glares .	1
johnny tried to smile back weakly .	1
nancy just looked at him blankly , and then shook her head .	1
he didnt feel much like a super spy at that moment .	1
* * * johnny stood glumly in line at the cafeteria .	1
he stared at the cold looking food waiting for him when he finally got to the end .	1
johnny always tried to remind himself to make his own lunch at home , to spare him the fake looking and tasting food that the school always offered , but he never found the time to make it when he remembered .	1
next time for sure , he promised himself .	1
the line shuffled forward .	1
the cafeteria lady plumped a nice helping of fake mashed potatoes and gravy on the next students plate , not looking too happy while she did it .	1
no one at the school really knew her name ; she never looked at anyone and never initiated or responded much to conversation .	1
because of that , she was just known as the cafeteria lady .	1
next , she droned in her bored , tired voice .	1
the line shuffled forward again .	1
the cafeteria lady plunked the next helping of fake food down onto nancys plate , weighing it down considerably and forcing nancy to compensate to keep her tray up .	1
thank you , nancy said .	1
next , replied the cafeteria lady .	1
johnny really wanted to talk to nancy , but he didnt want to give up his place in line .	1
he looked behind him and saw how far the line stretched back .	1
johnny would have to start all over again if he lost his place .	1
no one in the line behind him looked very happy ; they were probably all thinking the same thing about making their lunches next time .	1
maybe missing lunch wasnt the worst thing in the world ?	1
nancy weaved her way around students and tables , looking for a place to sit .	1
johnny decided he had to talk to nancy .	1
he left his place in line , much to the dismay of the student behind him who would now be served his lunch that much faster .	1
johnny trailed nancy , trying to quickly dodge the students faster than she was so he could catch up to her .	1
he wasnt really looking in front of him and ran straight into a student who purposely moved to block his way .	1
the student was really big ; it was like running into a soft wall .	1
johnny looked up , way up , to see bob looking down , way down at him .	1
bob didnt look very happy either ; it must have been something that was contagious at school that week .	1
two other students appeared on either side of bob : frank and jim .	1
the three of them were always around each other because no one else in the school was big enough to survive their rough behavior .	1
you werent watching where i was going , bob said to him .	1
a mistake i will never make again , johnny quickly replied as he tried to side step bob , frank and jim .	1
the three of them all shifted over to block his way again .	1
johnny had completely lost sight of nancy now , but then again he pretty much lost sight of everything except the three of them at the moment .	1
you made the mistake again , bob leered down at him .	1
johnny didnt understand .	1
he never really did anything to bother bob in the past , and while he always saw the three of them picking on other students , johnny was never one of their targets .	1
he always felt guilty that he never helped those students stand up to these bullies , and he pretty much knew without a doubt that no one would be coming to help him now .	1
it served him right for turning a blind eye .	1
looks like youre surrounded by the fourth wall , said frank while he hit his fist into his palm .	1
johnny almost laughed out loud .	1
they called themselves the fourth wall because they thought they were all so big that if they had one more member they could hold a roof over their heads .	1
at least thats what johnny thought they meant .	1
it was hard to tell when each one of them was already as big as a house .	1
i dont have time for this right now , johnny tried as he moved to the right to slide past them again .	1
predictably , the entire fourth wall shifted with him , once again blocking his way .	1
johnny was nervous .	1
worse , he couldnt understand why he was nervous .	1
he was a super spy , and could take out entire platoons of guards , sneak past high tech security , and single handedly save the world from evil .	1
yet here he was being confronted by three bullies and he was at a loss as to what to do .	1
hed like to think it was because now he was johnny clunker , and clunker kept a low profile , stayed out of peoples way , and didnt save the world on an almost daily basis .	1
you just made time , bob said .	1
by now all the students in the cafeteria were watching them .	1
johnny looked uncomfortably around at everyone , trying to remember how he got into this mess in the first place .	1
it seemed that every time he wanted to talk to nancy , he was running into people trying to stop him .	1
johnny looked bob in the eye .	1
i dont want to hurt you .	1
bob laughed .	1
several people in the cafeteria laughed along .	1
some of them were laughing because , johnny had to admit , it was genuinely funny .	1
bob must have weighed three times more than him , and johnny could only imagine how odd his warning must have looked .	1
but some of the other people were laughing out of relief because they were usually the target of the fourth walls attacks .	1
this johnny didnt find so funny .	1
people should stick up for themselves .	1
johnny was going to show them how .	1
somewhere in the back of his mind , johnny knew he wasnt acting in the best way to protect his secret identity .	1
im serious .	1
if you continue to get in my way , im going to have to put you in your place , johnny said with an icy cold stare .	1
wham !	1
bob punched johnny hard in the stomach .	1
johnny instantly fell to his knees and tried to get some breath into his lungs .	1
he hadnt seen that coming ; must have been a sucker punch .	1
some super spy he was turning out to be .	1
i think you hurt my fist with all your skin and bones , bob laughed .	1
leave him alone !	1
johnny looked up through the pain to find that nancy was standing beside him .	1
he tried to tell her to get out of the way , but he still couldnt remember how to breathe .	1
looks like your moms here to save you , frank laughed .	1
this was slowly turning from bad to worse .	1
it was bad enough that he couldnt take out the fourth wall , but it was worse that he might be rescued by a girl .	1
again !	1
enough was enough .	1
johnny struggled to stand up and face down his bullies .	1
walk away , right now , johnny said , a calm inner strength radiating from him before he ruined the effect by coughing and trying to get more air into his lungs .	1
still , the bullies did pause for a moment , and momentarily looked at each other and wondered what they should do .	1
but then they remembered that they were the fourth wall , and they backed down from nobody .	1
im scared , bob said sarcastically , and he took another swing at johnny .	1
dozens of thoughts raced through johnnys mind .	1
first , he started thinking about the quickest way to take down all three bullies , but then he began revising his plan to try and keep his secret identity a secret by not revealing his skills to all the people that were watching the fight .	1
but there simply wasnt any more time to think .	1
johnny intercepted the swing near his face , making it look like he got hit , and shifted slightly , redirecting the hit toward frank while pretending to stumble forward .	1
frank caught the punch right in his face .	1
johnnys back was towards jim and jim wasted no time in taking advantage of an unfair situation .	1
he swung at the back of johnnys head with all his might .	1
but before his fist could get there , nancy dropped down on one leg and swung out with her other one , kicking jims knees out from under him .	1
jim fell to the ground in a large heap .	1
johnny looked over at jim , and then back at nancy .	1
youre welcome , she said .	1
before bob knew what was going on , he had lost two of his accomplices .	1
looks like youll have to be the first wall now , johnny commented , before realizing that he was screwing up his secret identity again .	1
i mean , please dont hurt me !	1
bob didnt understand what was going on , was clunker joking ?	1
what had just happened to frank and jim ?	1
i am going to hurt you !	1
bob declared , his simple mind latching onto the last thing he had heard and going with it .	1
with a yell , bob charged at johnny .	1
bob was a very large kid , and once he got moving there was almost nothing that could stop him .	1
johnny waited until the last possible moment , and then spun and rolled out of the way , throwing himself sprawling onto the ground to look like he tripped .	1
bob watched him go out of the corner of his eye , but like a freight train he just kept moving forward , unable to stop .	1
the crowd of spectators had a moment to look on in horror before bob plowed right into them , knocking at least a dozen students to the ground and managing to land on a good number of them .	1
nancy looked on in amazement at the carnage spread out all around them .	1
hands and feet tried to poke out from under bobs massive form , there were muffled cries for help and groans of pain .	1
bob just looked dazed .	1
what do we have here ?	1
an icy cold voice asked from behind johnny .	1
johnny cringed .	1
he knew that voice ; he dreaded that voice .	1
slowly he turned around to see ms. sniders disapproving look spread out to all of them like a lighthouse beam , slashing back and forth to include everyone in the area .	1
she reached down with each hand and clamped her fingers on franks and jims ears .	1
they yelped in pain .	1
she pulled them up .	1
they struggled to stand up as fast as they could before she could yank their ears off of their head .	1
she did it with machine-like precision , and it looked like she would have been able to pick them up all by herself if they didnt cooperate .	1
we dont like disruptions in the cafeteria , do we now ?	1
she asked everyone .	1
johnny could see the crowd start to quietly disperse as the students tried to slink away before they were singled out by ms. sniders .	1
he and nancy had no chance to do that ; ms. sniders had already focused her intense , cold , half smile on him .	1
johnny had no idea how someone could show so many outward signs of emotion without seeming to feel them .	1
for some reason her eyes always looked lifeless and cold .	1
it was the worst when she smiled .	1
do we ?	1
she asked again , directing the question to frank and jim beside her .	1
no !	1
yelped frank .	1
we dont , pleaded jim .	1
johnny forgot what the original question was .	1
she smiled that cold , hard smile at them and released their ears .	1
then she turned to bob , who was just then struggling to get off of the people crushed under him .	1
bob looked up , saw ms. sniders looking at him , and froze .	1
im sorry , he squeaked .	1
she nodded a cold , grim nod .	1
finally , ms. sniders turned her gaze on johnny and nancy .	1
this is quite a ruckus you have caused , isnt it , she told them .	1
they started it , johnny tried to explain .	1
it seems perfectly obvious to everyone who was the instigator here , ms. sniders continued .	1
detention , today , for both of you , she declared .	1
what ?	1
nancy all but shouted .	1
ms. sniders looked at nancy .	1
nancy froze under that gaze as if ms. sniders was medusa .	1
do you think , perhaps , that we are being unfair ?	1
perhaps one detention is not enough , you may need more time to think about what you have done .	1
nancy and johnny looked down at the ground .	1
ms. sniders continued to glare at them , almost daring them to say anything else .	1
finally , satisfied , her face broke into a thin smile , but her eyes were still cold and lifeless .	1
ms. sniders turned and walked away from them .	1
* * * henry clunker was frantic .	1
he was hunched over his desk , shifting through piles of paperwork and tossing it around with abandon , creating a bigger mess than he had before .	1
the desk was filled to overflowing with paper , pens , clipboards , used coffee mugs , and a large , old computer .	1
not finding what it was he was looking for , henry dumped the massive pile back onto his desk and started opening his desk drawers , banging his elbow on the cubicle wall behind him .	1
henrys cubicle was in the corner of the fifth floor , barely bigger than his desk , giving him almost no room to move the hard , wooden chair he sat on .	1
other people around him had more space , with newer computers and more comfortably shaped chairs .	1
i know its here somewhere , henry said out loud .	1
it had to be there because henry never threw anything out .	1
his entire cubicle was one large deposit of paper waste .	1
he kept digging , accidentally knocking over a large pile and then watching in dismay as the entire stack tipped over and fell to the floor .	1
henry dove to his knees and starting picking up the paper , resigning himself to a long and difficult day , when he found himself staring at a pair of expensive shoes right in front of him .	1
the shoes were attached to legs , and the legs were attached to mr. underling , his boss .	1
henry , down on his hands and knees , slowly looked up to see mr. underling glaring down at him .	1
mr. underling was an old man , with chalk white hair and eyebrows .	1
he had a white mustache that looked out of style , and complemented his entire look with a white button up shirt and a black tie and pants .	1
it looked very much like mr. underling hadnt yet discovered color .	1
henry , by comparison , had a mixture of browns and grays that didnt seem to go together very well .	1
he never spent as much time figuring out what to wear as he should , but then he spent even less time thinking about what people thought about his appearance , so it all worked out rather well .	1
when he heard other people talk about the black and white drabness of mr. underlings outfits , henry would support his boss by saying that at least his color scheme made it easy to pick him out in a crowd .	1
people always thought that henry was joking ; it was what saved him from being a complete social outcast .	1
have you found that sales report yet , clinker ?	1
his boss boomed .	1
its clunker , henry corrected .	1
his boss scowled at him .	1
almost , ive narrowed it down to the right side , henry said triumphantly as he stood up and gestured to the city of paper buildings that were on his desk .	1
we are in a meeting right now , and we cant go on until you present the sales report .	1
ive almost got it , henry stalled for time .	1
mr. underling shook his head as he looked at what henry would have to search through .	1
why dont you just get it off the computer and print it out again ?	1
mr. underling said .	1
my computer is still booting up , henry explained .	1
i turn it on first thing in the morning , and then its up and running just before lunch time .	1
mr. underling shook his head again .	1
just get me the report , and then get into the meeting to give it to me !	1
mr. underling stormed off before henry could respond .	1
henry tried to explain to mr. underlings back that he was just in the process of doing that very thing when he realized at the last moment that it might look like he was being sarcastic .	1
still , he had to say something to let his boss know that he was hard at work trying to fulfill his wishes .	1
okay !	1
henry called out after him , yelling it out loudly enough that mr. underling would hear him from the distance he had traveled .	1
mr. underling stopped , turned , and glared at him again .	1
a few other heads popped up from cubicles to stare at henry .	1
henry waved weakly and then sat back down on his hard chair .	1
maybe he shouldnt have yelled quite so loud ?	1
maybe he shouldnt have said anything at all ?	1
maybe he should have come in early to give his computer a head start in booting up ?	1
what was he supposed to be doing again ?	1
looking for the sales report !	1
henry started sorting through the piles of paper with renewed energy , like he was digging for buried treasure .	1
* * * henry knocked weakly on the closed door of the conference room .	1
hello ?	1
he practically whispered to the door .	1
he tried knocking again , and then he waited .	1
henry could hear voices on the other side , but he wasnt sure if anyone could hear him .	1
he certainly didnt want to yell out again , once that day was clearly enough .	1
hello , i found it , henry whispered again , clutching several pieces of paper in his hand as he knocked again .	1
henry was going to have to assert himself a bit more ; he was going to have to open the door and go in boldly .	1
didnt mr. underling say he needed this report ?	1
henry could picture it now .	1
mr. underling was probably at the front of the room stalling for time , waiting for henry to swoop in and save him with the report .	1
henry turned the knob of the door as slowly and quietly as he could .	1
the door creaked open and henry started tiptoeing into the room .	1
he kept his eyes down and tried to move as slowly as possible so as not to attract any attention .	1
now he just had to locate mr. underling and slide him the report without anyone noticing .	1
he could do it at a time when the presentation was getting loud , and everyone had their attention diverted .	1
henry kept his eyes on the ground .	1
he had managed to walk inside , but he was still standing by the door .	1
he was going to have to look up if he was to find where mr. underling was .	1
but he didnt want to look up because , to henrys way of thinking , by looking up he would attract attention .	1
unfortunately , the presentation didnt seem to be getting louder .	1
now that henry thought about it , he couldnt hear anything at all .	1
the voices that he heard from outside the door had completely stopped since he opened the door .	1
henry listened , and began to realize that there were no voices at all .	1
everything in the room was quiet .	1
henry looked up .	1
he saw twenty people , all in expensive business suits , looking back at him .	1
every single person in the room , including his boss mr. underling , had stopped what they were doing and were focusing their complete attention on henry .	1
henry wanted to pass out .	1
he noticed that he was still clutching the door knob with a straining hand .	1
henry smiled weakly and let go of the door .	1
he had been hunched over , trying to make himself smaller when he had gone into the room , and now he straightened up and gave a small wave to everyone .	1
no one waved back .	1
mr. underling was still angrily staring at him from the front of the room .	1
henry had interrupted whatever presentation he was giving by trying to enter as quietly as possible .	1
well ?	1
mr. underling finally asked .	1
well ?	1
well what ?	1
what was henry doing here again ?	1
he looked down at his hand and saw the sales report clutched in a shaking , life threatening grip .	1
the sales report !	1
he cried in relief as he held up the papers which were in danger of being crumpled up in his hand .	1
well ?	1
mr. underling said again , holding out his hand for the papers .	1
henry looked confused at mr. underlings outstretched hand before he realized that mr. underling wanted henry to give him the papers .	1
henry hated when he got this nervous ; it was a wonder that he remembered how to breathe under the stress he felt .	1
yes , here is the sales report , henry tried to say with an air of authority as he put the slightly crumpled papers in mr. underlings hand .	1
youll find everything you need is there for the numbers to make sense , henry continued , when he really should have just stayed quiet .	1
mr. underling didnt respond ; he just looked over the reports silently .	1
henry looked out to all the other people in the meeting , who were looking blankly back at him and mr. underling .	1
henry didnt want to keep looking at all those people that were looking at him , so he went back to staring at the floor .	1
mr. crinkle .	1
henry kept studying the floor .	1
crinkle !	1
henry looked up with a start to see mr. underling fuming at him .	1
its , uh , clunker , sir , henry tried to explain .	1
mr. underling shoved the papers back in henrys hands .	1
henry was confused .	1
arent all the papers here ?	1
henry asked weakly as he started going through them .	1
they are there all right , theres only one small problem , mr. underling was talking in a really calm voice , which was scaring henry more than if he were yelling at the top of his lungs .	1
and then henry saw the month beside the date on the sales report .	1
oh no , this is last months sales report , henry stated with fear .	1
it gets better than that , mr. underling said in his deadly calm .	1
it is last months and last years sales report !	1
henry slowly moved his eyes back up the page to see the year beside the month beside the date column .	1
there it was , plain as day .	1
henry had just delivered a sales report to his boss that was over a year old .	1
slowly , he looked back up at his boss and tried to smile .	1
it looks like the company did well last year , henry tried .	1
no one laughed .	1
* * * johnny hated detention .	1
he didnt have it yet , but sitting in the office waiting to speak to the principal , he knew he was going to get it .	1
technically he did have it , because ms. sniders had already given it to him , but he knew that students could get these things overturned if they said the right things to the principal .	1
nancy opened the door from the principals office and came and sat down beside him .	1
at least he was finally going to get a chance to talk to her .	1
can you believe it ?	1
we got blamed for starting the fight !	1
johnny started complaining instantly .	1
we have more important things to worry about , nancy said .	1
like getting the super chip back .	1
we never even had it in the first place , johnny said .	1
you know what i mean , she returned hotly .	1
in the short time johnny had known her , he got the distinct impression that nancy liked to lecture him on things .	1
maybe it made her feel like she was better than he was ?	1
or maybe she felt because she knew some things better she knew everything better ?	1
relax , well get it , johnny replied casually , trying to be a bit condescending to get back at her for lecturing him .	1
it didnt work .	1
do you know what the super chip does ?	1
nancy said in her most perfectly annoying lecturing voice .	1
of course i do , everyone does , johnny replied , trying to deflect her question .	1
it didnt work .	1
what does it do ?	1
she asked him point blank , the look on her face clearly suggesting that she didnt believe he knew .	1
it does the same thing a regular chip does and more , johnny replied vaguely .	1
wow , nancy replied , pretending to be impressed .	1
you really are a super spy .	1
johnny threw up his hands in resignation .	1
fine , i dont really know what it does .	1
so tell me already , again , for the second or third time , because you know you want to and theres nothing i can do to stop you .	1
im glad to see youre finally learning , she said .	1
johnny tried to think of something to say , but then just waved the thought away .	1
go on , he said .	1
just try to be less annoying than usual .	1
the super chip is faster than any other processor in existence .	1
its actually ten times faster , and has built in power for circumventing other computer bottlenecks .	1
it can run circles around other computers , it can steal passwords , break encryptions , discover hidden security backups .	1
with this chip , there is no defense against computer hacking .	1
they could steal money from bank accounts , break into important military installations , and hold the world for ransom .	1
nancy took a deep breath , waiting to get a reaction from johnny .	1
she didnt get one .	1
thats pretty much exactly what you said the first time , he told her .	1
but it doesnt seem to be sinking in .	1
you dont seem to fully realize the danger .	1
i get it , super chip plus bad guys equals super bad guys , he tried to assure her .	1
nancy looked like she was going to hit him .	1
youre very sure of yourself , arent you ?	1
she asked .	1
johnny leaned over , looking around the office as the people around them went about their work , oblivious to the importance of what the two of them were talking about .	1
i think its time to introduce you to the rest of the team .	1
from there we can formulate where the united order is most likely to meet to try and use the super chip .	1
you have a team behind you ?	1
nancy asked .	1
johnny shrugged , yeah , sure .	1
how else would i have learned my skills ?	1
or got a hold of the really cool gadgets ive got .	1
for the first time since johnny started talking to her , he could tell that nancy was really impressed and at a loss for words .	1
dont you have a team ?	1
he had to ask .	1
nancy looked away , studied the floor a bit .	1
you dont , do you ?	1
johnny pressed .	1
sure ive got one , an organization anyway , she answered flippantly .	1
but johnny wasnt fooled .	1
but then who trained you ?	1
or gave you those gadgets ?	1
johnny asked .	1
nancy thought he was getting really irritating , and was beginning to question whether working with him was such a good idea .	1
who needed a team ?	1
nancy had her handler , field operative , and trainer all in one person .	1
and as far as nancy was concerned , that was the only person she needed .	1
johnny simply wasnt as good a spy , in her mind , if he needed an entire team to help him .	1
the principal stuck her head out of her office , johnny clunker , i will see you now .	1
before johnny could respond she had disappeared back into her office .	1
its your turn , nancy pointed out , even though it was obvious .	1
dont think youre getting away from answering the question that easily , johnny smirked .	1
he could be so irritating sometimes !	1
you can ask me as much as you like , but im not going to tell you , nancy replied .	1
why not ?	1
because , its secret , nancy said defensively .	1
of course its secret , were super spies .	1
but im trusting you , you can trust me a little too , johnny said .	1
mr. clunker , are you coming or not ?	1
the principal asked again with an irritated voice as she stuck her head back out .	1
its your turn , mr. clunker , nancy said , putting the emphasis on his last name , which she knew he hated .	1
fine , johnny huffed , getting to his feet and preparing to enter the principals office .	1
just let me know one thing before i go in there ; how much detention did you end up getting for the cafeteria incident ?	1
none , nancy replied .	1
none ?	1
johnny couldnt believe it .	1
not a single day , nancy replied smugly .	1
johnny brightened up a little .	1
maybe this wasnt going to be so bad .	1
the principal probably knew that this wasnt their fault , and that the fourth wall ended up starting everything , like they usually do .	1
were you asked anything ?	1
johnny inquired .	1
she asked me what happened , i told her , nancy replied .	1
so it was going to be that easy , johnny thought to himself as he turned to head into the principals office .	1
still , from johnnys experience he knew that nothing usually went that smoothly .	1
he looked back at nancy before he went in .	1
what , exactly , did you tell her ?	1
he asked .	1
i told her it was all your fault , nancy answered .	1
chapter 3 : department x two weeks of detention !	1
johnny cried for what must have been the millionth time .	1
nancy rolled her eyes as she had to hear about it again .	1
do you know how long that will take to serve ?	1
johnny asked .	1
two weeks ?	1
nancy replied .	1
hardly !	1
johnny paced away from her in the small cramped confines of the steel elevator they were in .	1
before she could breathe a sigh of relief , he walked back over and started up again .	1
they might say its two weeks , johnny continued , but every day feels like a year .	1
and since i have to serve ten school days of detention , it will feel like ten years of time !	1
but it will still be over in two weeks , nancy offered .	1
johnny squinted his eyes and gave her a look .	1
werent you listening ?	1
he asked .	1
i was trying not to .	1
it was all thanks to you , he declared .	1
you dont have to thank me .	1
believe me , i wont !	1
he yelled .	1
johnnys yell reverberated off the walls of the quickly descending elevator .	1
they were traveling down , deep into the earth , where johnnys secret spy group , department x , had one of its main operations centers .	1
nancy was quite impressed already , but she tried to appear nonchalant about the whole thing .	1
johnny had taken her to a garbage dump .	1
and in the garbage dump was a cast off shipping container .	1
there had been a lock on the container that looked too expensive for it to be there .	1
johnny had entered a code and they had stepped inside the container .	1
the next thing nancy knew she was in a super sonic elevator traveling at high speeds .	1
a screen came up on the elevator wall with ackers face on it .	1
nancy was a little taken aback upon seeing all the pimples all over his face , but she did her best to hide her reaction .	1
ackers was watching her closely ; he hated when people looked at his pimples .	1
what are you looking at ?	1
ackers jumped right to the point .	1
nancy looked away , trying to appear casual , before acting surprised that the question was directed at her .	1
johnny knew exactly what was going on .	1
whatever you do , dont say anything about the pimples , he whispered to her .	1
or ill be in even more trouble .	1
what did you say ?	1
ackers asked johnny .	1
nothing , johnny also looked around the elevator , trying to look casual .	1
the two of them made an odd couple , with both johnny and nancy looking everywhere but at the large wall sized screen with a close up on ackers face .	1
ackers wasnt very good at social interaction .	1
he looked back and forth between them , trying to figure out what was going on when it should have been obvious .	1
part of him must have been acting subconsciously , trying to provoke them into responding .	1
why else would he have projected such a large image of himself ?	1
how far does this elevator go ?	1
nancy finally had to ask .	1
far , agent ackers responded from the screen .	1
it wouldnt be much of a secret base if anyone could dig a small hole in the ground and find it , now would it ?	1
ackers turned his attention to johnny .	1
and i told you not to bring her down here .	1
its supposed to be a secret base .	1
secret , as in we dont introduce everyone we meet to it , as in we do our best to keep people from finding out about it , as in we dont let people in !	1
i dont suppose im being clear ?	1
very clear , johnny said , biting back remarks that would only lead to having to listen to ackers talk more .	1
ackers was always very condescending .	1
using his exceptional brilliance , which unfortunately everyone had to admit he had or they would hear about it for days , ackers tended to put on an air of entitlement .	1
it made him hard to get along with most of the time .	1
after what seemed like an eternity of silence , mostly because ackers was scrutinizing them from the view screen , the elevator finally came to a stop with a sudden lurch .	1
nancy lost her balance and johnny caught her .	1
they held that pose for a moment before she broke free and johnny started coughing to hide his embarrassment .	1
i didnt need any help , she said , looking anywhere but at johnny or ackers .	1
of course not , he agreed , trying to get past the moment as quickly as possible .	1
the doors of the elevator opened to show agent ackers standing before them .	1
he was skinny and tall , easily a head above both of them , and he had even more pimples in person than he had on the view screen .	1
as he spoke , the large image on the wall of the elevator continued to broadcast his image even though he was standing right in front of them .	1
the effect was more than a little unsettling .	1
welcome to department x , ackers said .	1
nancy mouthed the words without saying them out loud .	1
a dreadful name , i know , ackers confided .	1
i petitioned to get them to change it .	1
i tried going for department z , thats the last letter in the alphabet , and i also tried department a , but so far i havent heard back from anyone .	1
lets face it , if you cant be the first or the last whats the point of being anything in the middle ?	1
johnny could see that nancy was about to ask a question .	1
no , dont do it , johnny warned .	1
do what ?	1
nancy played innocent .	1
dont make fun of him , or ask any legitimate questions you might have .	1
whatever youre thinking , its just not worth it .	1
nancy punched johnnys arm .	1
ow , he said , looking at her warily .	1
that was worth it , nancy smiled .	1
well , what a fine couple you both make .	1
i suppose youll end up playing this silly game for a while before realizing you like each other .	1
and then the games will get even more embarrassing .	1
its common practice among your species , ackers said all in one breath , implying that he somehow did not belong to the human race .	1
we dont like each other , nancy stated defiantly .	1
yeah , was all that johnny could add .	1
ackers raised an eyebrow at his one word response .	1
johnny just shrugged , too tired to argue with ackers .	1
just show us to the debrief area , johnny said with a tired voice .	1
nancy couldnt help it .	1
she kept staring at the pimples on ackers face .	1
he noticed her staring out of the corner of his eye and looked directly at her , at which point she looked away .	1
he nodded knowingly .	1
i suppose you dont recognize me .	1
im the guy from the monitor , ackers pointed unnecessarily at the view screen where they had been looking at him as the elevator traveled down , and which was still showing a large image of his face as he spoke .	1
i was employing a graphical enhancer to subtly alter my face and hide my identity .	1
you never know when you might need to remain anonymous and conceal yourself right in the open so that no one recognizes you in the field , he continued .	1
it wasnt much of a graphical enhancer because ackers looked almost exactly the same as he did on the screen except for a few subtle shifts here and there on his face there wasnt much that was different .	1
nancy saw the look from johnny and immediately played along .	1
right , i didnt recognize you .	1
thats a great trick , she managed to say .	1
i know , ackers smugly responded .	1
are you going to stand in the elevator all day ?	1
we have important things to discuss , ackers chastised them , and then , without waiting for their response , he turned and started walking down the hall .	1
johnny and nancy had to hurry to keep up .	1
they walked down an all white hallway , with white walls , ceilings and floors .	1
it felt like they were in a hospital , except everything around them seemed to be more futuristic and advanced somehow .	1
even the lights that were in the ceiling didnt look like they were coming from regular light bulbs .	1
ackers caught nancy studying the ceiling as they walked .	1
super sensitive , digital interference probes shoot out of the light .	1
the probes swirl around you , mapping a three dimensional computer representation of you as you walk .	1
that representation is then stored in our computers and cross referenced whenever we need to find out where you are in the world , ackers said as he walked , never slowing his pace .	1
nancy could tell that he enjoyed showing off , he liked trying to appear smarter than everyone else , even if it meant putting them down and making people feel bad .	1
actually , i was wondering why everything is white , she replied , trying to throw ackers off .	1
its because ackers has no creativity , johnny responded .	1
i designed this place , ackers jumped in as soon as he could .	1
i oversaw almost all aspects of its creation and construction .	1
there was a limited budget and time constraints , and too many variables to meld together an effective color scheme .	1
in other words , it was nancys turn to interrupt , you didnt have time to paint .	1
ackers lifted an eyebrow at her .	1
there are far more important things to worry about than painting , he replied .	1
as they walked down the white , sterile hallway , the three started to pass rooms on either side with reinforced , plastic windows that allowed you to look in .	1
there were a variety of training exercises and technology testing sites in the different rooms .	1
nancy looked in and saw a man standing in front of a large cannon .	1
the cannon erupted a steady stream of fire that completely engulfed the man .	1
nancy couldnt see him through the flames , but when the cannon was turned off , the man was looking unharmed and vastly relieved .	1
we invented sun tan lotion as a byproduct of our fire protection technology , ackers explained .	1
we released to the public a much milder dose , of course .	1
our lotion protects everything from hair to skin ; its the ultimate in fire safety .	1
ackers gave her a smug smile that suggested he didnt know how to smile very well .	1
for his extreme intelligence , there seemed to be a lot ackers didnt know about social interactions .	1
the next room they passed was completely empty .	1
there was nothing in it at all .	1
as nancy stopped to watch , water started pouring down like heavy rain from the ceiling .	1
soon a humanoid shape started to appear in the middle of the rain , with arcs of electricity dancing around it until it finally took shape in the form of a man .	1
invisibility , ackers said .	1
still havent found a way to make it waterproof .	1
the united order has a model that works in a similar way , but their model has such a drain on power resources that they can only use it for a small amount of time .	1
ackers continued walking , not even waiting to see if they would follow .	1
where are we going ?	1
nancy had to ask .	1
to my office , ackers explained as if it was the most obvious thing in the world .	1
we need to figure out how to account for the both of you blundering the last mission and allowing the super chip to get away .	1
we didnt blunder it away , johnny started to argue .	1
there were more of them than us .	1
plus , i had to save him , nancy nudged johnny .	1
ackers gave johnny a hard , long look .	1
i would have known all about it if i wasnt stuck in radio silence land , he pouted with a completely straight face , something that only ackers could do .	1
were not going to bring that up again , are we ?	1
johnny asked .	1
how can i bring it up again ?	1
i wasnt finished bringing it up the first time , ackers argued .	1
i have one big complaint with you , as opposed to a grouping of smaller ones , that just never gets resolved .	1
and with that ackers marched on ahead , leaving nancy and johnny to watch him walk alone up the hall to his office .	1
at least he wasnt mad , said johnny .	1
id hate to see him when hes mad , nancy replied .	1
yes , you would , johnny agreed .	1
* * * now im really mad !	1
ackers exclaimed .	1
johnny and nancy had just found their way into his small , cramped office .	1
there were papers everywhere , and several desks to put them on , but there was only one chair .	1
it was clear that ackers worked alone , possibly because he didnt like working with other people , but more likely because no one wanted to work with him .	1
the walls were also covered with writing , both on and off the multiple whiteboards around the room .	1
usually a sentence or equation would start on a white board written in black marker .	1
but after there was no more space , the writing would continue off the board and onto the wall , sometimes even making its way across the wall and onto a new white board .	1
it was clear that ackers liked to think .	1
it was also clear that there was probably no one alive who could follow his line of thought , at least not very well .	1
i left for less than five minutes and my lunch is completely gone !	1
ackers whined .	1
nancy leaned over to whisper in johnnys ear .	1
who is he talking to ?	1
its not us , is it ?	1
she asked .	1
youll see , was all he would say back .	1
i left my lunch right here , on this very spot .	1
it was a sandwich , with ham and cheese .	1
and now all i see are bread crumbs , ackers continued .	1
what did we say about eating my lunch when im gone ?	1
ackers asked .	1
no one responded .	1
it looked like the three of them were the only ones in the small room .	1
bread crumbs !	1
ackers called out .	1
nancy jumped , confused that ackers wasnt looking at the bread crumbs when he yelled .	1
there was a low whine that came from under the other desk .	1
you know what you did , theres no use hiding , ackers said .	1
well , theres some use hiding , but ill find you anyway .	1
a computerized voice responded .	1
it emphasized both syllables with an exaggerated change of pitch going from really high to really low .	1
sorry , it said .	1
naturally youre sorry , but you still have to come out and face what youve done , ackers said .	1
johnny was quickly losing patience .	1
what about the super chip ?	1
thats the reason i came all the way down here .	1
and the reason i brought her along with me , johnny pointed at nancy , who was currently enthralled with wondering what manner of creature or machine was hiding under the desk .	1
in a moment , ackers didnt even bother to look at him as he spoke .	1
i have to address this immediately so that she learns .	1
nancy looked over at johnny .	1
johnny just shrugged back helplessly .	1
come on out now , ackers called , and we can get past this unpleasantness as quickly as possible .	1
sorry , the robotic sounding high and low pitch came again from under the desk .	1
out .	1
now , ackers commanded .	1
slowly , a hesitant furry face and two paws appeared from under the desk .	1
it dragged its small body out and then came up to stand before the three of them , looking tentatively up at ackers .	1
bread crumbs , who started panting as she stood there , was a small poodle .	1
sorry , came the robotic voice again while bread crumbs continued panting uninterrupted .	1
as nancy looked closely at bread crumbs , she noticed that there was a small speaker attached to the collar around her neck .	1
he taught his dog to speak ?	1
nancy whispered to johnny in bewilderment .	1
not exactly , johnny whispered back .	1
ackers smiled , it was one of the rare moments in his life when he did , and patted bread crumbs on the head .	1
thats a good girl , run along now .	1
bread crumbs started wagging her tail and then bounced off to find more food .	1
the only thing she knows how to say is sorry , johnny finished whispering to nancy .	1
turning to ackers , johnny added , if you know shes going to eat your lunch when you leave , why do you keep leaving it where you know she can get to it ?	1
ackers was just finishing wiping the crumbs off the table and onto a napkin .	1
he turned and gave johnny a condescending stare .	1
how else will she learn ?	1
he asked with an obvious huff .	1
but i suppose im partially to blame .	1
by naming her bread crumbs ive practically doomed her to identifying with and living out the very behavior im trying to eradicate .	1
it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for her to try and live up to her name and what she might see as part of her reason for being , her destiny so to speak .	1
ackers turned to look at them with a stoic face , do you think i should have called her dont eat ?	1
nancy looked over to johnny to try and figure out if ackers was kidding or really asking them their opinion on such a crazy question .	1
johnny shrugged .	1
there really was no way to explain ackers ; he was just a person you had to experience for yourself to actually believe someone like him existed .	1
no , thats fine .	1
bread crumbs is a great name , johnny said to ackers .	1
yes , i know .	1
obviously i couldnt name her dont eat ; how long do you think she would have lived ?	1
no , dont answer that , ackers turned from the two of them and approached one of his computers .	1
he typed in a few words and hit enter .	1
a holographic display of a screen emerged in the air along with a keyboard floating beside it .	1
ackers started typing on the keyboard and maps began appearing on the screen .	1
after you two bungled acquiring the super chip , i put my superior intellect into action trying to pinpoint its new location .	1
we now know where the chip is going to be tested .	1
its in a united order base hidden within the city in the basement of a building posing as a bank , ackers said in one large breath .	1
how did you find out where the chip was ?	1
nancy asked as she studied the screens .	1
i told you , i used my superior intellect , ackers said with a straight face .	1
dont ask , he never tells , johnny tried to explain .	1
of course i never tell .	1
first theres the matter that you wouldnt be able to fathom my explanations .	1
then theres the issue of job security ; if anyone else could do what i could then i would be replaced .	1
now , moving on , your assignment will be to infiltrate the structure .	1
as ackers spoke , a three dimensional representation of the building came up on the screen .	1
he zoomed in and out , cycled through the floors of the building and drew xs and lines through different rooms .	1
what do you think youre doing ?	1
a female voice came from the computer as ackers was typing .	1
an image of a woman wearing a silver body suit appeared beside the display of the bank .	1
are you taking up my resources trying to show little maps of buildings ?	1
the woman continued .	1
ackers sighed and went into a frenzy , typing on the three dimensional keyboard at lightning speed .	1
the woman frowned .	1
you dont think you can get rid of me that easily ?	1
she asked .	1
suddenly , she disappeared , and the only thing left on the displays was the three dimensional map of the building .	1
actually , i do , ackers said as he finished entering a string of codes .	1
what was that ?	1
nancy asked .	1
that was ackers girlfriend , ayai , johnny responded .	1
she is not my girlfriend .	1
she is a highly advanced form of intelligence that i have been working on .	1
shes going to be the first true artificial intelligence .	1
ayai will be capable of her own thought and even able to make creative decisions .	1
when she is finished , of course .	1
right now she only appears life-like because i programmed her to be a real pain in the ass , ackers added .	1
ackers studied the holographic display on the wall .	1
it looks like the best course of action would be to sneak in through the front door ; theyll never be expecting that .	1
i have a few new gadgets that ive invented that youll be using .	1
ackers turned to nancy after he finished looking over the plan .	1
i imagine that your agency , whoever they might be , will also be supporting this operation with equipment and people ?	1
nancy looked sideways at johnny , who looked questioningly back .	1
ive got a few gadgets , some things i made on the side , but we wont be joined by anyone else from my organization , she stammered out .	1
you mean to tell me you make your own gadgets ?	1
ackers was appalled .	1
what kind of second-hand outfit do you work for ?	1
its not second-hand .	1
and yes , i make my own gadgets , so what ?	1
nancy was getting angry .	1
she didnt come here to be insulted .	1
ackers shook his head .	1
he always had to explain everything to everyone .	1
the people who invent the gadgets are the top brains in any spy organization , so naturally they never put themselves at risk in the field .	1
thats for people like him , ackers tilted his head in johnnys direction .	1
i guess you could say they are more expendable .	1
hello ?	1
johnny waved incredulously .	1
im standing right here , hearing everything you say .	1
ackers continued on , ignoring him .	1
and how can you have no one to add to this mission ?	1
well be adding four top operatives that will be joining you .	1
the least you could do is lend us a couple of agents in a nice show of cooperation .	1
nancy threw up her hands in exasperation .	1
there are no other agents on my team !	1
johnny and ackers turned to each other in stunned silence .	1
you work alone ?	1
johnny managed to finally say .	1
no , i have a handler , someone who trains me and plans the missions , nancy offered .	1
ackers narrowed his eyes in suspicion .	1
who is this handler ?	1
perhaps i should look them up in my database .	1
i have a very extensive database ; its one of my pet projects .	1
its got everything in it .	1
you work with me , you get to know nothing about my handler , thats the way it goes , nancy said guardedly .	1
her handler is probably a criminal .	1
i see this kind of thing all the time , ackers said .	1
some poor lost soul trying to make up for the bad things theyve done in their life .	1
nancy laughed .	1
my handler is as far away from lost as someone could be .	1
shes a very capable woman whos taught me all i know .	1
ackers nodded happily to himself .	1
we now know shes a woman ; that narrows it down to only half the population .	1
ackers shook his head as he switched off his database and computer , if agent seventy-seven has nothing to add to this mission except herself , then perhaps we dont need any more of her help .	1
i think you should thank her for her time and send her on her way .	1
nancy looked incredulously at ackers , its my turn to be in the room , standing right in front of you while you talk about me .	1
dont you hate it when he does that ?	1
johnny asked .	1
ackers shuffled over to the computer on his desk and powered it down also .	1
fine , if i am forced to speak directly to you , without anyone to soften my delivery as to the harshness of my message , then i will .	1
we dont need you , ackers explained .	1
nancy looked wordlessly at johnny .	1
johnny sighed .	1
we brought her all the way here , showed her our base .	1
she really helped me out .	1
i think she should be on the team for now , johnny said .	1
if i am forced to work with even more amateurs , while i constantly put up with their shortcomings , then that is what i will do .	1
after all , what difference would one more person make ?	1
ackers asked while he looked at nancy .	1
gee , thanks .	1
its really great to be a part of this team , nancy replied .	1
oh , dont thank me .	1
wait until you meet the rest of the team , ackers said ominously .	1
* * * the rest of the team was crazy , nancy concluded instantly .	1
she was in a training room surrounded by high tech equipment and lethal weapons watching the group try to kill each other for practice .	1
johnny and ackers were standing beside her , but nancy couldnt help thinking that they were all in danger just for being this close to the group , which was currently sparring with a robotic army and , as far as nancy could tell , each other .	1
three of the robots attacked big petey , a huge giant of a young man with muscles bulging out of his shirt .	1
the robots punched and pummeled big petey , but he didnt seem to feel any of the hits .	1
he actually laughed at one of them .	1
then the robots tried to all jump on top of him and bring him to the ground .	1
big petey waited until they were all on top , then he gathered them together in one giant ball , and threw all three of them into the nearby wall .	1
nancy watched as they landed in a scrap heap , too twisted and scrunched together to do anything else .	1
red crept up behind big petey .	1
she was slightly older than him , in her late twenties , and had a fiery temper to match her hair .	1
she decided this was the best time to attack big petey .	1
she had various types of explosives strapped to her , and while big petey wasnt watching , she came up behind him and slapped some ball-shaped goo onto his back .	1
red ducked as big petey swung a meaty fist behind him .	1
you want to play ?	1
he asked her right before the ball attached to his back exploded .	1
instead of sending him flying across the room , the goo pulled big petey down toward the ground , anchoring him flat on his back .	1
i want to play , red confirmed as she looked down on him .	1
next time watch your back .	1
big petey tried to get up off the ground but he seemed to be stuck there .	1
i thought thats what you were for ?	1
he asked , looking up at her .	1
not today , sweetie , she laughed as she walked away .	1
ackers turned to regard nancy , shes an explosives expert .	1
except her explosives usually do everything but explode in the conventional sense .	1
she makes them all herself , which should please you immensely , and frustrates me to no end .	1
shes pretty talented for someone who isnt me , he explained .	1
nancy turned her attention to the next member of the group .	1
in the middle of the training area stood a skinny looking guy in his mid to late thirties .	1
he was holding a pencil and clipboard in his hand , and he had really thick glasses that looked like they threatened to drive his head down to the ground .	1
his name was vinnie , and he didnt look very formidable or capable of defending himself .	1
he mumbled to himself as he walked into harms way , with a group of robots attacking him from all sides .	1
the probability of the next attack , vinnie mumbled to himself as he ducked a punch from one robot , sidestepped a strike from another , and then put himself right in between the two adversaries , should be coming from angles relative to the opportunity of best advantage as it is perceived from a mechanical viewpoint .	1
both robots pulled out laser pistols and aimed them at vinnie .	1
hence the most obvious solution , and the only real source of victory vinnie mumbled to himself .	1
the robots fired just as vinnie ducked .	1
the laser blasts sailed harmlessly over his head and both robots ended up shooting each other in the chest .	1
is to duck , vinnie concluded .	1
the robots stood there for a moment , their circuits sputtering and shorting out , before falling over with a large , heavy clunking sound .	1
vinnie kept mumbling to himself as he walked over to ackers , nancy and johnny .	1
he never looked up at them as he walked , he just kept jotting down notes on the clipboard he held in his hand .	1
that was very impressive , nancy commented .	1
not really , vinnie answered , still looking at his notes .	1
it was really more of an inevitability ; if one knows the proper angles of attack and thought processes of his opponent , there really is only one outcome to ultimately destroy them .	1
vinnie is a probability expert , psychologist and battlefield strategist , ackers explained to nancy .	1
and he thinks hes almost as smart as me .	1
vinnie pushed the glasses back firmly onto his nose and shifted his center of gravity back a bit .	1
you should see my notes on ackers , vinnie commented .	1
hes got inferiority complexes on his inferiority complexes .	1
ackers looked like he was trying to figure out what to say next .	1
he stammered and opened his mouth , but then shut it again and turned away .	1
whos the newbie ?	1
a voice came from behind nancy .	1
she turned around to see a woman , about eighteen years old , dressed all in black .	1
her long brown hair was tightly pulled back in a ponytail .	1
this , ackers finally found his voice , is silence .	1
and youll find that she is anything but her code name .	1
she looks green .	1
hate to be with her on the battlefield , silence continued .	1
nancy turned to regard her tormentor .	1
i think youll find that i can hold my own , nancy said .	1
silence walked up to her , unsheathing two long swords and twirling them through the air in wide circles , interchanging them both from hand to hand .	1
really ?	1
i highly doubt that , silence said as she stepped forward , bringing the spinning blades closer to nancy .	1
why dont you show me ?	1
dont worry about her .	1
she likes to talk a lot , but youll like her better when you get to know her , johnny tried to put in .	1
i dont like her at all so far , nancy remarked .	1
good , silence responded as she came in closer with her spinning weapons .	1
the blades were very close to nancy , she could feel the air whoosh by as they passed near her through the spinning arc of the attack pattern .	1
lightning quick , nancys hand shot out and she intercepted silences wrist , striking it right on a nerve .	1
her hand went numb from the impact , and silence was forced to let go of one of her swords as nancy kicked the other one to the ground .	1
the first sword flew out of her hand and sailed through the air .	1
it went right past ackers head , narrowly missing him and impaling itself in the wall .	1
for a moment everyone was frozen .	1
and then silence and nancy exploded into a fury of movement .	1
they were attacking and counter attacking each other faster than everyone could keep up .	1
silence would throw a punch , only to have nancy duck in underneath it and come up at her side , sweeping her leg low and tripping silence to the floor .	1
silence fell down , but not before grabbing nancy and flipping her .	1
both girls went down , and both started attacking and blocking each other before they could even stand up .	1
everyone was focused on the fight except for ackers , who turned his head and looked at the sword sticking out of the wall .	1
did you see how close that came to me ?	1
